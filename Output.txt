THE history of the Nayaks of Madura is a subject which
has received some attention already, and there have been
a few attempts at presenting that history in a connected
form. Both Nelson’s Manual of the Madura Country and
Caldwell’s History of Tinnevelly have become out,of date
owing to the fresh material that has been brought to bear
upon the subject, chiefly by the advance made in epigraphi-
cal researches, and, to a smaller extent, ‘by manuscript
work, The latest effort of Mr. V. Rangachari in the
columns of the Indian Antiquary has not used the Jesuit
records which are invaluable to the history of the Madura
country. A thorough and systematic exploitation of these
invaluable records, and the presentation of a connected
account of this important family of Vijayanagar Viceroys
seemed called for. Mr. Sathyanatha Aiyar, B.A. (Hons.),
who stood the first of his year in the History Honours exam-
ination of this University wasawarded a University Research
Studentship and was set to do this work. He set himself
to acquire a knowledge of French for this purpose, and has
been able to translate the relevant records so well that both
the Rev. P. Carty, S.J. and the Professor of French in
the St. Joseph’s College, Trichinopoly, found very little in
his translation to alter or amend by way of improvement.
The following pages contain his thesis followed by a series
of appendices containing the material upon which the
dissertation is based, on the plan originally adopted for
the Madras University Historical Series. The essay speaks
for itself, and needs no commendation from me. My part
of the work I have purposely limited to that of the editor.

page 11: xi PREFACE

Throughout the work wherever an opinion was offered
I have left it substantially as such, only modifying where
it might have had the appearance of exaggeration either
by way of over-statement or underestimate. I have added
a few notes, some of them long, throughout where a
modification of any importance seemed called for. In this
prefatory note, I wish to draw attention to a general
remark on the Jesuit records on page 252 which seems to
be somewhat of anover-statement. I have let it go though
somewhat modified, but Mr. Sathyanatha Aiyar agrecs with
me that there is a slight over-statement in it and the remark
may not be fully justifiable. I note the correction therefore
with great pleasure here, and I am glad to know that he is
in agreement with me on the matter.

I may record with pleasure here, that during the ycars
that Sathyanatha Aiyar was working with me he was not
only attentive to his own work, but was of great assistance
to me in some of my own. He was able to take a sensible
view in matters of discussion, and his criticisms always
showed the right spirit. I must acknowledge the great
interest that the Rev. P. Carty, Mr. Sathyanatha Aiyar’s
Professor in the St. Joseph's College, took in this work
and the assistance that he rendered by lending the student
one of the volumes of the Jesuit records which was not
available in Madras. My thanks are also due to him
for the kindness with which he and the Rey. J. Bourdot,
S.J., Professor of French in the College, went through
the Appendix A critically. Their approval of the trans-
lation gives it great authority. I record with pleasure my
appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered by Mr. C.
W. Stewart, now Manager of the Oxford University Press,
Calcutta, in seeing the work through the press, and by
Mr. George Kenneth, the Superintendent of the Madras

Diocesan Press, for the neat execution of the /printing
of the work.

liberality in including this book in the Madras University

page 16: INTRODUCTION

THE history of the Nayaks of Madura comprises the history
practically of the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and the
first third of the eighteenth centuries, and carries the
history of South India from the best days of the empire
of Vijayanagar to the eve of the British occupation of the
Carnatic. It might be described as, in essential particulars,
a continuation of the struggle for Hindu independence in
the south against the advancing tide of Muhammadan
conquest which threatened its very existence at the com- .
mencement of the fourteenth century. The cause of
Hindu independence, for which the last great Hoysala,
Vira Ballala, lost his life in Trichinopoly, was finally over-
thrown by Chanda Sahib who drove, by a perfidious act
of his, the last Nayak Queen, Minakshi, to commit suicide
in or about the year 1736.

The thesis that follows is an attempt to present a
connected history of this viceroyalty of the empire of
Vijayanagar, the farthest viceroyalty from the vulnerable
frontier of the north, By turning out the Muhammadan
garrison in occupation of its capital, the officers of Vira
Ballala laid the foundations of Vijayanagar, which stood as
a bulwark for two and a half centuries in stemming the
flowing tide of Muhammadan advance into this region of
South India. There was much besides in connection with
this viceroyalty which makes its history interesting in a
peculiar way.

The viceroyalty of Madura happened to be the scene of
European enterprise in the coast regions in founding trade-
centres which ultimately developed more or less into ruling
powers, struggling for mastery first as auxiliaries of native

page 17: 2 INTRODUCTION

powers and later each for its own particular advancement.
The first European power that presented itself actively in
this region of India was the Portuguese. It appeared
in the double character of a commercial power, in posses-
sion of salient positions along the coast and some
strips of territory, and of an organized political power
behind the efforts of missionaries, particularly Jesuits,
in the earlier stages of their work among the fisher-folk
of the coast country of the Pandyas. The earliest
organized missionary effort was made in the territory
of the Nayaks of Madura, and their capital, Madura,
itself constituted an important missionary centre, though
it shared this honour very early with Trichinopoly. The
history of Madura, therefore, should be of miuch interest,
if worked up with sufficient fulness by the Systematic
exploitation of available sources.

For the understanding of this history, the salient features
of the history of Vijayanagar as far as it came into contact
with its great southern viceroyalty is 4 prime necessity.
The Muhammadan invasions that began at the end of the
thirteenth century swept over the peninsula like a hurri-
cane, and when they ceased ‘they left garrisons behind in
salient positions, like 30 many nails in the coffin of Hindu
independence in the south. Two of these.Muhammadan
cantonments in the Tamil country. stand out clear. The
one was placed in Madura, from which the descendants of
the ancient Pandyas retired. practically once for all, thus
paying the penalty for the sin of inviting Muhammadan
intervention in a war of succession. The other was
an outpost of this, placed in Kannantir, the old Hoyéala
capital, about five miles north of the Coleroon, across
the island of Srirangam. These were apparently regarded
as of sufficient importance to justify’ the’ constitution
of: the province of Ma‘bar as one among ‘the twenty-three
provinces that:. constituted the .empire .of Muhammad

page 18: INTRODUCTION 5

Tughlug. It was the rebellion of Muhammad’s cousin,
Bahau-d-Din, at Sagar that made a breach in the line of
communication between the provinces of Deogir and
Ma‘bar. This was taken advantage of by Vira Ballala, who
drove a wedge, as it were, between these two provinces by
establishing himself in a strong position at Tiruvannamalai,
planting at the same time several important garrison-posts
in a triple line along the northern frontier. The provincial
revolts that followed the rebellion of Bahau-d-Din so
entangled Muhammad in a perpetual struggle to bring
revolted provinces back to allegiance in the north that he
hardly found time to pay any attention worth the name
to the south. The Muhammadan province of Ma‘bar, if
it is worth being so called, was thus isolated and had to
struggle for mere existence for a period of about ten years,
in the course of which the struggle went through several
stages. The Hoygala monarch began a sweeping move-
ment, sending out his armies from Trichinopoly across
Pudukotta and Ramnad as far down as Raméfvaram. This
succeeded in the main and drove the Muhammadans of
Madura to make a desperate effort to save themselves.
They had their reward that in the changing fortunes’ of
war Vira Ballala fell a victim to their perfidious valour.
This disaster to the Hindus only deferred the doom of the
Muhammadan settlement in Madura for a few years. The
officers of the last two Ballalas, who were associated
with them -intimately in their last struggles, carried the
war to victory by persistent effort. Among a number
of these officers engaged in what to them was the holy
cause.of the Hindus, stood out a group of five brothers,
whose efforts were ably seconded by a son of the third
one, who is said, in the local chronicles of Madura, to have,
held the position’ of the ‘door-keeper’ of the last great
Hoyégala,” Vira Ballila III. It was this prince, Kumara
Kampana, ‘as hé was called, that was responsible for the

page 19: 4 INTRODUCTION

subversion of the Muhammadan dynasty of Madura, and it is
this conquest that has provided the subject for the epic
poem, Madhura Vijayam, said to have been composed by
one of his wives, Gangadévi. Inscriptions refer to the efforts
made by him to introduce order into the territory recently
taken over from the Muhammadans, in, or before, the year
1358, and so it may be said with justification that the
acquisition of the province of Madura by the empire of the
Hoysgalas marks the foundation of the empire of Vijaya-
nagar, as much as the laying of the foundation-stone of the
great fortress thirty years before this, on the banks of
the Tungabhadra, The province of Madura, therefore,
was one of the earliest acquisitions that transformed what
was the kingdom of the Hoysalas into the empire of
Vijayanagar.

The kingdom of the Pandyas had been conquered by the
Cholas and incorporated in their empire early in their
career. It was the great Chola king, Rajendra, the Gangai-
konda Chola, perhaps the greatest conqueror among the
members of a great dynasty, that was ultimately responsible
for the extinction of Pandya independence. For a century
and a half after his conquest the Pandyas were feudatory
to the Cholas, who exercised their authority oftentimes
by appointing viceroys over the territory, to whom the
Pandya monarchs had to be subordinate. In the latter
half of the thirteenth century the Chola power had so
far loosened its hold on the Pandyas as to enable them
to make an effort at independence. In this effort they
were able to enlist the sympathies of the great Ceylon
ruler, Parikrama Bahu, on their side. This war between
the Pandyas.and the Ceylonese, on the one side, and the
Cholas, on the other, waxed and waned till at last the
Ceylonese auxiliaries were beaten back and the Pandyas
reduced politically to still greater depths of degradation by
the last great Chola ruler, Kulottunga III. This brought

page 20: INTRODUCTION 5

about a natural revulsion. By other shiftings of political
combinations, the Pandyas were able early to turn the tables
upon the Cholas, and began a glorious imperial career
which lasted for very near a century. It was on the death
of one of the greatest among these Pandyas that there
broke out a war between brothers for the succession. At
the invitation of one of them the Muhammadans entered
the Pandya country, the Chola power having by that time
become extinct. In the course of the struggle for Pandyan
independence referred to above, a certain number of chief-
tains from the Chola country seem to have been planted in
various localities in the Ramnad and Madura districts to
hold the Pandya power in check; one set of these chief-
tains, who had their territories in Manamadura and the
country round it, had the title Mavali Vanadarayars. They
seem to have held on during the period of the Pandya
ascendancy by changing their allegiance, and we find them
early in the history of Vijayanagar in the same region.
During the period of Muhammadan occupation of Madura,
lasting a little more than fifty years, we do not hear of the
Pandyas anywhere near Madura, and, after the Muham-
madan power became extinct, they hardly show themselves
under the first viceroys of Vijayanagar. So we may take
it that, with the occupation of Madura by Malik Kafur
some time in 1310, and notwithstanding the possible
temporary turning-out of the Muhammadan garrison by
the Malabar ruler, Ravi Varman Kulagekhara, in 1316, the
Pandyas had practically lost their hold over Madura.
With the first viceroys of Vijayanagar in Madura, who
were generally princes of the blood, appear these Mévali
Vanadarayar chieftains, holding important posts around the
city of Madura itself. The institution of the viceroyalty of
Madura therefore began almost with the foundation of
Vijayanagar, and Kumara Kampana may well be taken to
be the first viceroy, his nephew following in the same

page 21: 6 INTRODUCTION

exalted office under the first emperor of Vijayanagar,
Harthara II.

The next time that the viceroyalty of Madura comes
into prominence is under Dévariya II when we hear of
two brothers, known by the names Lakkana and Madana, in
charge of the whole of the Tamil country. The latter
seems to have had for his charge the Tanjore country; the
former held high office at headquarters, probably with the
government of Madura as his province, the adminis-
tration of which he carried on by deputy. At one period
about 1440 he is found in the south, and is given the
title Viceroy of Madura and ‘ Lord of the Southern Ocean ',
This latter title, as a new addition, is a clear indication that
the authority of the empire then came into touch with the
sea, and that the overseas transactions of Madura under
the great Pandyas of the thirteenth and the early-fourteenth
centuries had devolved upon the empire. [From this high
commission Lakkana was called back to hoadquarters, after
a defeat sustained by the imperial armics at the hands of
the Muhammadan Sultan of the Dakhan, to reform the
army and to reorganize the resources with a view to final
victory. It is apparently this Dannaik (Dandandyaka) that
is spoken of in such glowing terms by the Muhammadan
traveller, Abdur Razzak, who was in Vijayanagar in
1442-3.

With the death of Dévariya in 1449 the empire fell
into some disorder owing to the recurring hostility of the
Muhammadans, aggravated during a little more than a
decade by the advent of a new power in alliance with them,
namely, the rising power of the Gajapatis of Kalinga
(Orissa). The first ruler of this dynasty comes into view
some time about 1335 and had been actively exerting
himself to extend his frontier along the coast. He had so
far succeeded that the Nellore district had passed under
him, with Udayagiri as the outermost post in the possession

page 22: INTRODUCTION 7

of the Kalinga ruler, and Kalinga raids were carried at
least as far as the South Arcot district, as some of the
inscriptions in the localities indicate. This difficulty of the
empire in the north is reflected in the looseness of the
imperial hold on the southern viceroyalty. When, in the
period of the usurpation of Sdluva Narasinga, we hear of
his general, Narasa, winning a victory against a certain
Pandya, by name Manabhiisha, the inference seems clear
that the Pandyas, who had retired to Tinnevelly, made
an effort either to regain their independence or increase their
patrimony by taking advantage of these difficulties of the
empire. The period of trouble, extending almost from 1450
to the beginning of the next century, and followéd by a
general revolt of the provinces under Vira Narasimha, who
came to the throne in 1505, called for drastic action and
a. reconstitution of the viceroyalties as soon as the external
enemies were beaten back and a reorganization of the
empire could be taken in hand.

Such an organization could be undertaken only under
Krishnadéva Raya. When he came to the throne about the
end of 1509, the aggressive activity of the Portuguese was
well under weigh. The Muhammadan activities on the
northern frontier were somewhat subdued owing to their
own difficulties and dissensions within, The aggression of
the Gajapati had attained its zenith and Oriyan raids had
been carried as far south as the Tanjore district itself. In
this posture of affairs it is conceivable that the distant
province of Madura had lapsed into a region of warring
chieftains struggling each one to appropriate as much as he
could for himself. Krishna went about systematically sup-
pressing rebellions within and bringing home-provinces
under complete control. He came to an understanding with
the Portuguese and gave them such terms that they were
kept within bounds of commercial requirements. He made
a demonstration in force to impress the Muhammadans-on

page 23: 8 INTRODUCTION

the northern frontier and strengthen the garrisons against
them. He had to make a great effort to beat the intruding
Gajapati out of the territories of the empire and come to a
definitive treaty with him. That done, he could undertake
the reorganization of the empireitself. This reorganization
was, as Krishna’s inscriptions make clear, undertaken afte
the year 1520, the date of the battle of Raichir. As soon as
he returned from the great campaign against the Gajapati,
he went on a tour to the south. From this apparently he
came back to headquarters and undertook the expedi-
tion to beat back the Adil Shah from his aggressive advance
into the Raichtir Doab. Having cleared the Doab ol
Bijapur forces, he started back again on his southern tour.
The period 1520-5 seems to be the period of activity in
organization, and may be regarded as the period when he
appointed Vira Narasimha as viceroy of the Chola country
and gave the commission to Nagama to organize the pro-
vince of Madura. It is probable that Krishna had an
attack of serious illness, as we have a record of Achyuta,
of date 1525, issued from Vijayanagar itself. This, com-
bined with a few others in the name of his young son
of about the same time, indicate a government by regency
of some kind. It was, probably, then that the disorderly
elements in the more distant provinces began to show
themselves again. That seems the period of Nagama’s
activity in the southern viceroyalty.

Nagama seems to have been a tried officer of the usurper,
Saluva Narasinga, like Narasa, the father of Krishna,
himself. In point of eminence Nagama does not appear
to have been very far behind Narasa himself in the
estimation of their master, He could not have been very
much his inferior in point of seniority to attain to that
particular position. By his own statement, Krishna was
not a man who would have entrusted important and trouble-
some governments to untried men. The ‘appointment

page 24: INTRODUCTION 9

of Vira Narasimha to the Chola country would indicate
the appointment of a similar officer of high standing
for Madura. Nagama's administration must have been
thorough-going and probably entailed considerable hardship
on the petty chieftains who traced their descent from
the great Pandyas of the thirteenth and early fourteenth
centuries and who naturally put their claims too high
for the acceptance of the uncompromising viceroy. It
is just possible that complaints reached headquarters in
some number, and one complainant with more pretentious
claims even waited upon Krishna in person. The only
flaw in the story as given in the chronicles is that we have
so far come upon no epigraphical evidence of the existence
of a Chandrasékhara Pandya in Madura or of a Virasekhara
in the Chola country, though neither case is impossible.
The royal families of the Cholas and the Pandyas were in
power tillso recently that the existence of scions without
power or patrimony in some number is not an impossibi-
lity. Vira Narasimha, the viceroy of the Chola country,
rebelled in the very last years of Krishna for some reason
which we are not able to understand clearly, and fled
for safety to the Travancore couniry. It is probable
that the reasons that actuated the disobedience of two of
the most powerful governors about the same time were
the same. The close control that Krishna had always
attempted to exercise over the provincial governments
must have been galling to the powerful viceroys brought
up in the school of Saluva Narasinga and labouring to
bring the empire under a unified and systematic adminis-
tration. The Chola viceroy actually set up a rebellion and
fied the country in fear, while the Madura viceroy, at
greater distance, set the imperial authority at defiance
without going so far as setting up a rebellion and trying
to hold his own against the mandate of the emperor,
This seems how the breach came about, and the impatient
a

page 25: 10 INTRODUCTION

emperor, like Henry II of England, cried out in impotent
rage, was there none of his henchmen who would bring
the recalcitrant viceroy toa sense of discipline. Iven the
romantic tale of young Vigvandtha’s war against his own
father would not seem, in the circumstances, unlikely.

The foundation of the Nayakship of Madura has been
given different dates, and the whole discussion in regard
to the foundation of the viceroyalty is due to want of
sufficient appreciation of the position of Madura under the
empire to the end of the reign of Krishnadeva Raya. It has
already been pointed out that the foundation of the
viceroyalty of Madura goes back almost to the foundation
of the empire itself. The actual point under discussion is
not when the subordinate government of Madura was
constituted as an integral part of the empire, but when
the Nayakship as a semi-independent governmeni under
& comparatively nominal overlordship of the empire,
actually began. In other words, what is the actual date
of the beginning of comparatively independent rule under
the Nayaks of Madura? The two issues are different
in character and certainly take very different dating.
The foundation of the viceroyalty as such is at some
date between 1345 and 1358, the period of break in
the coins of the Sultans of Madura. According to the
work of Gangadévi above referred to, the Sultan of Madura
was killed in battle by Kumara Kampana. Inscriptions, of
date equivalent to 1358, refer to the orderly administration
that this prince introduced in the territories disturbed
by Muhammadan occupation some time anterior to
the date of the inscription. The foundation of quasi«
independent rule under the Nayaks is given the date
1558-9. If the foundation of Nayak rule be the equivalent
of the foundation of semi-independent rule, this date
may well be accepted as a satisfactory date and that,
perhaps, is the meaning implied by those records that

page 26: INTRODUCTION it

try to fix a date for the foundation of the Nayakship.
That has, however, been confounded with the appointment
of Vigvanatha to the Nayakship of Madura in succession
to his father. The Nayakship of Vigvanitha must have
begun some time in the last years of the reign of the great
king Krishna of Vijayanagar, and may be ascribed to the
date 1529-30 for the reasons advanced in my introduction
to the Sources of Vijayanagar History (Madras Univer-
sity Historical Series, I). Nagama’s disobedience and
Vira Narasimha’s rebellion in the Chola country both were
somehow connected, and while Krishna succeeded in
bringing Nagama to a sense of discipline, Vira Narasimha
escaped punishment by flight into the Travancore country.
Almost the first act of Achyuta’s reign is his own march
at the head of his army against this recalcitrant viceroy.
Achyuta proceeded only as far as Srirangam, the island in
the Kaveri near Trichinopoly, and the expedition to the
Tiruvadi country marched under his brother-in-law, Salak-
raju Timmarazu or Salakkam Tirumala, who voluntcered
service for this expedition. The expedition was a success ;
the government of the Tiruvadi country was reduced to
subordination, and the Pandya in gratitude gave one of his
daughters ‘in marriage to Achyuta. This means the Pandya
king obviously and not the viceroy of Madura. Visvanatha
was apparently governor of the Pandya country at the
time, but the magnitude of the enterprise as well as the
official position of the person involved called for the
superior intervention of the emperor himself or his special
deputy. -Vigvanatha’s position must have been that of an
ordinary governor of Madura, as yet unsettled owing to the
_various discordant elements constituting the viceroyalty at
the time. There were the Pandyas on the one side, the
Mavali*chieftains on the other, and other chieftains - of
various degtees of influence and importance who had to be:
brought under a system of administration represented by:

page 27: 12 INTRODUCTION

the viceroyalty of Madura. Vidvaniitha’s time must have
been occupied in devising a system that would meet the
demands of his government at the time, and his resources
in the circumstances could not have been equal to this
enterprise. But these circumstances did not prevent the
viceroy of ‘Madura bearing his part in any special
commission under the command of an imperial general.
Evidence that this was the position of the viceroy will
appear later. Achyuta, having settled the disturbance in
the south country, made a progress through his dominions,
which terminated on the banks of the Krishna some time
in the year 1534, as a record of a grant by him, from
his camp on the banks of the river, for the merit of his
mother, shows. Thereafter Achyuta lapses into a kind
of obscurity which may be entirely due to our want of
knowledge, but seems none the less due to some extra-
ordinary difficulties which he had to contend against.
Our material for the history of the next decade is com-
paratively scanty, and all that can be gleaned from the
only accessible sources shows a state of things in the capital
which left the provincial governments to themselves,
Achyuta somehow let his authority lapse, perhaps by his
own default, into the hands of two of his brothers-in-law,
and this remissness on his part set up against him a
powerful and influential party, headed by three brothers,
claiming to be sons-in-law either of Krishnadeva Raya
himself or of his third brother, Ranga, which seems to have
had the countenance or active support of even the queens
of Krishna. This gradually developing rebellion was com-
plicated by one or even two Bijapur invasions, and ended
in the deposition and death of Achyuta’s son, Venkata,
who succeeded for a brief space after Achyuta’s death.
Sadasiva, a nephew of Achyuta and ason of his late brother
Ranga, was installed on the throne, the real authority
being exercised by the three brothers, So far as the

page 28: INTRODUCTION 13

southern viceroyalty was concerned, imperial intervention
was called for under peculiar stress of circumstances after
the first two or three years of the new reign.

In the settlement introduced after the Travancore war,
Achyuta seems to have made a rearrangement of the
territories between Tanjore and Madura, appointing Chinna
Chevva (Sevvappa Nayaka), the husband of his sister-in-
law, to the viceroyalty of Tanjore, which probably did
not include the whole charge of Vira Narasimha but took in
some part of the territory from the viceroyalty of Madura.
The reconstituted viceroyalty included probably all the
present-day districts of Madura and Ramnad, and the
overlordship apparently of the southern portions of the
Madura district and Tinnevelly, where the descendants of
the Pandyas, legitimate and illegitimate, held sway under
the suzerainty of the viceroy himself. The territories of
these Pandya chieftains were in touch with the Travancore
country and were liable to invasions from Travancore.
The coast region was open to Portuguese enterprise and
the chief ports of the south contained Portuguese factories
and were otherwise accessible to Portuguese commercial
enterprise. This enterprise involved, in respect of the
Portuguese, a certain amount of missionary enterprise as
well. The advent of Francis Xavier in the southern region
created a new and powerful influence, the political aspects
of which have not received adequate attention among
the historians of this period. The Paravas, the fisher-
folk along the coast, were being rapidly converted to
Christianity, and such conversion was interpreted as in-
volving a change of allegiance of the inhabitants from
their Indian rulers to the king of Portugal. This
wholesale conversion of a class of industrious inhabit-
ants of the coast, including among them those engaged in
pearl-fishing, made them ipso facto subjects of the king of.
Portugal. This meant the transfer of the coast country of

page 29: 14 INTRODUCTION

the south from allegiance to the empire of Vijayanagar to
that of the king of Portugal by the act of a successful
missionary and his companions, a position which the
empire could not look on with indiffcrence under any
circumstances. Following as it did an extension of
authority by the ruler of Travancore, who carried his arms
successfully across the whole of the peninsula and asserted
his authority even in Tuticorin, it called for drastic action
on the part of the empire. These two dangers, almost
simultaneous in their incidence, called again for imperial
intervention and a special imperial officer had to be
deputed on this commission. This was the invasion of
the Tiruvadi country by Ramaraja Vitthala, a cousin of
the three brothers who actually carried on the adminis-
tration in the name of Sadasiva. His commission wag
to bring the Tiruvadi to a sense of his own limita-
tions and reduce the Parava coast to its normal sense
of political allegiance. Xavicr’s complaints about the
atrocities of the ‘ Badages’ and his wailing against the
drastic measures these ‘Badages’ took have reference to
this. Ramarija Vitthala and his younger brother, Timma,
after him, seern to have exercised this superior commission
and remained in the Pandya country for more than ten
years. During this period the viceroy of Madura, Visva-
natha, and his son, Krishnappa, had to be subordinate to
this special officer. The viceroy bore his part loyally, and
even his young son, Krishnappa, distinguished himself in
the fighting line. Vitthala’s commission extended perhaps
even to an invasion of Ceylon, in which this young prince
seems to have taken part. When at last Ramataja
Vittbala and his brother had concluded these wars and
introduced an ordered administration within and secured
the acknowledgment of the imperial authority among the
powers outside of the frontier, they left the viceroyalty
extended in its sphere both of territory and political

page 30: INTRODUCTION 15

influence to the viceroy Visvanatha. Assumption of this
higher authority by Visvandtha, after the completion of
Ramaraja Vitthala’s commission in the south, marks an
epoch in the history of the viceroyalty, and has probably been
fastened upon by chroniclers as the date of the foundation of
the viceroyalty of Madura. This is not unreasonable if regard
is had to the fact that the power and prestige of the vice-
royalty, as thus reconstituted, went back to the position that
it occupied under another previous special commissioner, the
great Dannayak, Lakkana, in the reign of Devaraya II.
This devolution of the viceroyalty, extended in its sphere
and exalted in its privileges, upon Visvanatha marks the
foundation of the viceroyalty or Nayakship. That is how the
dating 1558-9 for this event can be accounted for. The
province had certainly been organized to some extent under
Visvanatha before the arrival of these special commis-
sioners. The latter had apparently to destroy the external
dangers that threatened the viceroyalty and introduce well-
regulated relationship between the viceregal headquarters
and the more important feudatories within the territory of the
viceroyalty proper and on its borderland. It is not surpris-
ing that this work occupied a period of close upon ten years.
The reformed viceroyalty, therefore, may be regarded as
something quite different from the viceroyalty as held by
Nagama, and by Vigvanatha in succession to him. The
government of the viceroyalty was apparently carried on un-
eventfully till the epoch-making battle of Talikota, which
seriously damaged the prestige of the empire and made its
position in respect of the great viceroyalties behind it some
what weaker. The transference of the headquarters from
the front line at Vijayanagar to the second at Penukonda in
itself is an expression of a certain faintness of heart in the
councils of the empire. The empire went on unimpaired,
however, during the reign of Tirumala, notwithstanding the
fact that the imperial family, in the person of Sadagiva, was

page 31: 16 INTRODUCTION

put aside some years after the battle either by Sadisiva’s
death in the course of nature or otherwise. The arrangement
that Tirumala made on the eve of his death for the carrying
on of the administration of the empire marks the beginning
of a division which both nature and history perhaps justified
at the time, but was pregnant with conscquences fatal to
the unily of the empire. He had three sons surviving at
the time. The eldest, Sriranga, was to succeed to the
empire as a whole. Under him were to be his two younger
brothers as some kind of superior viceroys, one having for
his territory practically all the country above the ghats
with his headquarters at Srirangapattanam. This charge
was given to Rama, the second surviving son. All the
country below the ghats, excepting the region immediately
under the headquarters at Penukonda, but including within
it the Tonda, Chola, and the Pandya Mandalams together
with the country of Travancore, was given to the youngest
brother, Venkata, who was similarly viceroy of the whole
region with his headquarters at Chandragiri. This arrange-
ment had in it certain obvious conveniences in the circum-
stances of the empire. The attention of the emperor would
be fully taken up with providing for the defence of the
northern frontier against the ever-threatening danger of
Muhammadan invasions either from Golkonda or Bijapur
or even the two together, as the attention of the northern
states of the Bahmani kingdoms was diverted by the first
beginnings of the Moghul movement in the Dakhan. Hence
this arrangement of the distribution of charges was
not in itself bad. The vital defect perhaps lay in the
imperfect grasp by the two viceroys of the essential need of
political unity. This was understood during the lifetime of
Sriranga, notwithstanding the misfortune that befell the
empire in the course of his reign in the year 1579-80.
In one of the many invasions of the territory of Penukonda
by the Muhammadan armies of Golkonda, Sriranga happened.

page 32: « INTRODUCTION 17

to fall a prisoner, and so remained for some time He was
set free, probably as the result of a treaty, and the empire
went on for another seven or eight years during his lifetime
uninjured by this calamity. When he died about 1586
his youngest brother, Venkata, succeeded to the throne;
Rama, the second brother, had apparently predeceased his
elder brother. The premonitory symptoms of the coming
disruption seem to have already made themselves felt when
the Madura Nayak, Virappa, made an effort at independence
soon after the siege of Penukonda in which Sriranga became
prisoner. Venkata, with the aid of the Nayak of Tanjore,
was able to assert his authority over Madura, and thus tide
over the first effort at disruption. This probably is what is
referred to as the battle of Vallamprakara in the Pudukottai
plates of Sri Vallabha and Varatunga Pandya. After
Venkata’s accession to the throne in 1585 the same
Madura viceroyalty seems to have created trouble, and
Venkata had to commission his young nephew to bring the
recalcitrant viceroy-to a sense of allegiance. ‘Tirumala, the
eldest son of Rama, instead of doing this his clear duty,
appears to have made common cause with the rebel viceroy,
and, instead of returning to the imperial headquarters, where
he was for the- time being as a young man, proceeded
straight to his father’s viceroyalty at Srirangapattanam,
thus marking the beginning of the disruption of the empire.
Venkata was able to reassert his authority for the time
being in Madura, but had to let his nephew alone, sulking
in Srirangapattanam. This series of events appear to have
happened in the last years of the century and the beginning
of the next. This want of good-will between the nephew-
viceroy and the uncle-emperor seems to have continued
unabated, so much so that the emperor looked on, perhaps
with satisfaction, at the extinction of the viceroyalty at
Srirangapattanam by the energetic exertions of a feudatory
chief in the person.of Raja Udaiyaér of Mysore, the
3

page 33: 18 INTRODUCTION

founder of the dynasty of His Highness the Maharaja
of Mysore. The emperor had his own difficulties to con-
tend against in the constant harrying invasions of
Golkonda, and, at the time that Srirangapattanam fell, he
was actually threatened with a sicge of his capital, from
which he was saved by the timely exertions of the Tanjore
forces under the command of the hcir-apparent, Raghunatha
Nayaka, That the emperor was not dissatisfied with
what had befallen his nephew is indicated in the charter
he issued in 1612 confirming the acquisition of the
Srirangapattanam viceroyalty by Réaja Udaiyir. The
younger brother of the ex-viceroy of Srirangapatianam
still remained at court apparently, so that, from the point
of view of the emperor, the viceroyalty passed from the
hands of a recalcitrant nephew whose loyalty was doubtful
to the hands of an enterprising chieftain whose future
loyalty he had no reason to suspect. The separation of
Srirangapattanam, therefore, may be regarded as the first act
of dismemberment of the empire, though for another
quarter of a century the ruler of this province conducted
himself as a loyal feudatory.

Venkata dying childless in 1614, his young nephew
Stiranga, who had apparently been known before as
‘ Chikkaraya’ (Yuvarija or heir-apparent), was declared, in
accordance with the wishes of Venkata, his successor in
the empire. Unfortunately for the empire there was a
young man brought up in the family as the son of one of
the queens of Venkata who came of the family of the Gobbiri
chiefs. Venkata and his councillors seem to have doubted
the maternity, and declared the nephew, Sriranga, emperor.
The Gobbiii chief, Jagga, took up the cause of this putative
son, and awaited an opportunity to massacre the whole of
the royal family and thus gain for his nephew the title to
the empire. He found the opportunity and succeeded in
destroying Sriranga and his children, three boys and two

page 34: INTRODUCTION 19

girls, excepting one of the boys, the middle one, as the
story has it, who was smuggled away by a washerman of
the royal family at the instance of a loyal chieftain,
Yachama Niyaka. Prince Rama having thus escaped the
holocaust of the royal family, a war of succession became
certain and provided the inevitable test of loyalty.
Yachama, a comparatively petty chieftain, could hardly
stand against the traitor, Jagga, and his allies, and looked
about for support among the great feudatories of the
empire. He found he could count upon the support of the
Nayak of Tanjore and of nobody else. The Nayak of
Madura stands out in bold relief as the head of the disloyal
combination against the fugitive prince and his protector,
Yachama, and, as such, against Tanjore. The Nayak of
Madura, the Nayak of Gingi, the Pandyas of Tinnevelly,
the Portuguese, and perhaps even distant Travancore stood
ranged on the side of the traitor. Mysore seems to have
held aloof in this war of succession. In the description
of the forces arrayed on either side of the now famous
battle of Toppiir, the name of Mysore does not occur in
any of the accounts. This absence of Mysore cannot be
explained altogether by the possibility of Muhammadan
invasions on the northern side. There was, perhaps, in it an
undercurrent of disloyalty, and there may have been the
excuse of an imminent Bijapur or Golkonda invasion from
the north. Whatever was the reason, Mysore did not show
itself on either side, while Madura stood out the champion
of the traitor Jagga. We have not the means to decide
whether the knowledge, that possibly Venkata possessed, of
the real character of the youth set up against his nominee,
was common enough to be shared by the feudatories of the
empire. Some of them may have honestly believed that
the candidate supported by Jagga was the real claimant,
but the general support that the accession of Sriranga
Chikka Raya had and the desperate step that Jagga took to

page 35: 20 INTRODUCTION

assert the claims of his nephew seem clear cnough indica»
tions of the general position in regard to the respective
claims of the two parties concerned. It would, therefore,
be reasonable to conclude that Jagga and his friends were
guilty of treason to the empire in the line of action that
they adopted in regard to this particular question. So
far as the history of the Nayaks of Madura is concerned,
this gives clear evidence of the lurking desire on the
part of the Nayaks, beginning with Virappa I, to make
themselves independent if a suitable opportunity offered
itself.

Thenceforward the position of the parties becomes
clear, and Madura must be counted among the feudatories
whose policy towards the empire was a great deal shaped
by the possibility of achieving independence. The guiding
consideration had become not loyalty to the cmpire but
the attitude of the other powerful fcudatories in regard to
this central question. During the reigns of Sriranga II
and his successor, Venkata IJ, the empire managed to hold
together, leaving the feudatorics pretty much to their
own devices to shape their policy as they liked. Hence
we see the imperial power maintaining the position of an
interested or disinterested spectator in all the shiftings and
changes of frontiers between the greater feudatories, among
them chiefly Madura and Mysore. This was duc to the
supreme need of the empire to make a stand against
Muhammadan advance, as Bijapur had begun her advance
in right earnest into the territory of the empire by coming
to an understanding early with Golkonda in regard to their
respective spheres of operations, Bijapur was to appropri-
ate as much of the Carnatic above the ghats as she could,
and Golkonda was to have a free hand in the portion of
the empire below the Ghats. The brunt of the Golkonda
aggression therefore fell upon the empire proper at Penu-
konda, and subsequently at Chandragiri, and lastly at

*

page 36: INTRODUCTION . Zi

Vellore. The brunt of the Bijapur aggression fell upon
Mysore and to a certain extent on Ikkérias well. In with-
standing the aggressions of Bijapur and keeping them within
bounds Mysore did, to a considerable extent, render services
to the empire. These services became greater as Mysore
extended her borders by appropriating the bulk of the
territories of the Channapattuna viceroyalty of Jagadéva
Rayal, which included a considerable portion of eastern
Mysore and the Baramahals of Salem. Bijapur was gradu-
ally able to absorb into her territory the Mysore districts
of Chittaldroog, Tumkur, and Kolar with almost one-half
of Bangalore. On this frontier Mysore asd Bijapur stood
face to face. Through all the vicissitudes of the empire
Madura had no such duty to discharge either to herself or
to the empire. Hence Mysore could always show herself
the champion of the empire while Madura had not that
excuse. When Sriranga III ascended the throne some time
about 1642, it must have seemed to him that the empire
was in a very bad condition and was maintaining an
unequal struggle for existence, chiefly through the want of
loyalty of the feudatories of the south, particularly the
powerful Nayak of Madura. He made an organized effort
to bring these Nayaks under allegiance to him. In this
move of his he could let Mysore go on, as she had so far
committed herself to no other act of disloyalty and was,
by actually occupying the Channapattana viceroyalty, put-
ting herself in the way of the aggressions of Bijapur, thus
rendering a service to the empire, though indirectly. The
empire had to bear alone and unaided the aggressions of
Golkonda. By persistent effort Golkonda was gradually
overpowering the empire. The clear duty of the southern
feudatories at the time was to have gone to the assistance
of the empire and thus enabled it to make a stand along
the second line of defence of the earlier empire. This
combination, co-operating with Mysore in the policy that

page 37: 22 INTRODUCTION

her own self-interest dictated, had very fair chances of
success, These were thrown away by the southern viceroys,
chiefly the Nayaks of Madura, and, not content with this,
Tirumala Nayaka committed himself to inviting the inter-
vention of Bijapur to prevent the cmperor’s marching
against himself. It is impossible to justify this act on the
part of Tirumaia as the facts were too clear and too much
above the surface for him not to have taken noice of them.
The best argument in his favour would be the possibilities
of aggression from Mysore. But aggression on the part of
Mysore was not possible: as it turned oui, it was not possible
till the aggressions of Bijapur were put an end to by the
active advance of the Moghuls in the Dakhan that came
later but not yet. It was this want of perception of the nceds
of the empire and the failure to adopt an imperial policy
by the Nayak of Madura that was primarily responsible for
the extinction of the empire. Mysore openly threw off the
yoke in 1646, and Tirumala Nayaka’s attitude against
the empire was no less open. For the next quarter of a
century or more the emperor could be regarded only as a
fugitive, now and then gaining the support of the loyal
feudatories and exerting himself to the utmost of his power
against odds which were too strong for him both within
and without. The fall of the empire marked the doom
of the viceroyalties without a doubt. Mysore saved herself
by a timely exertion against Bijapur and by keeping the
Madura Nayaks, as far as might be, beyond her own
borders,

The complicated transactions which are too indefinitely
reflected in the inscriptions embodying the details of
the conquest of frontier posts in the Kongu country
by Chikkadévaréja Udaiyar of Mysore require for a
proper understanding a short retrospect of the history of
the decade or fifteen years preceding. By the absorption
of the viceroyalty of Channapatjana, Chamariija of Mysore

page 38: INTRODUCTION 23

had brought the Mysore frontier in touch with the northern
frontier of Madura along the line of the foothills of the
ghats. The rest of the present-day state of Mysore was
acquired on behalf of Bijapur by the successful Bijapur
invasions in the same period under Randhula Khan and his
successors. After the retirement of the great general the
government of the region, which included in it the Bellary
district, the Chittaldroog, Tumkur, and Kolar districts in
Mysore with some outlying tracts, was entrusted to Shahji,
who acted as second-in-command under Randhula Khan.
The territory of the empire, which then was under
Venkata II, was hemmed in between the Bijapur territories
of Shahji and the conquests of Mir Jumla on behalf of
Golkonda, which ultimately he transformed into a fief of
his own with but nominal control from his liege-lord of
Golkonda. By a marriage alliance between the two rulers,
the Sultans of Bijapur and Golkonda brought about peace
between themselves, and since the settlement of 1636 the
Moghul danger had ceased to be imminent. When
Sriranga III came to the throne in 1642, the state of things,
so far as the empire went, seemed promising enough to keep
these two powers outside the frontier, if not of Penukonda
or Chandragiri, at any rate of Vellore. In the years
immediately following a change had taken place. Shahji
had stretched out a hand to Gingi, and was able easily
to occupy the fort in the interests of Bijapur to begin with,
but ultimately to make it a part of his own jaghir. In
this he seems to have received the co-operation of the Nayak
of Madura. It is apparently this aggression of Shahji
on behalf of Bijapur that is referred to in the Jesuit letters
as an act of treason to the empire on the part of Tirumala.
This advance of Bijapur was in all probability seconded
by the advance of the Golkonda forces on Vellore itself,
both having for their ultimate object to prevent the march
of Sriranga southwards for a successful assertion of his

page 39: 24 INTRODUCTION

authority over his feudatorics. Tirumala had successfully
circumvented the emperor by organizing a simultaneous
movement southwards of Golkonda and Bijapur. It was
probably in this connection that the emperor had to
double back upon Vellore, and succeeded in beating back
the Golkonda invasion and in raising the siege of Vellore.
In this successful enterprise of his he received efficient
help from Sivappa Nayaka of Ikkeri, who may not at
the time have usurped the throne. Apparently Golkonda
repeated her attacks and ultimately dislodged Sriranga
some time about 1646: this resulted in the move of Shahjji
towards Gingi. It is probably this precarious position
of the emperor that accounts for the assumption by
about 1646 of what seems formal independence by the
Mysore ruler, Kan{hirava Narasa. The fall of Vellore, the
occupation of Gingi, and this indication of independence
on the part of Mysore must have made Sriranga’s position
desperate, and, failing to secure useful assistance anywhere
near, he made an appeal to Shah Jahan in 1653, offering
even to become a convert to Islam if the emperor made it
a.condition preliminary to rendering him the -assistance
that would enable him to regain his territory. The appear-
ance of Aurangzib in the Dakhan and his machinations
to take possession both of Golkonda and of Bijapur put
new heart into the emperor, who apparently made another
effort to bring the Hindu rulers of the south together in
supporting him to beat the two Musalman states back into
their normal frontiers. In this effort probably he had the
countenance of Mysore, and Tirumala Nayaka’s unpatriotic
efforts against the success of this combination account in
all probability for the aggravated hostility between Mysore
and Madura. During the period 1652 to 1656 or 1647
the two Muhammadan states were fully occupied in their
efforts to keep outside the clutches of the octopus, Aurang-
zib, the Moghul viceroy of the Dakhan, Tho chances of

page 40: INTRODUCTION «25

success of a Hindu combination were therefore at the time
very good. For some reason or other the emperor got
estranged from the ruler of Mysore, and, instead of @
combination of all the Hindu states against the Muham-
madans, the Hindu states themselves divided into two
camps, and we have the spectacle of a combined attack
upon Mysore of all the other Hindu powers of the south.
Kanthirava Narasa had to struggle against this combination
and he managed to hold his own. His death and the
death of Tirumala Nayaka of Madura took place about the
same time. The Muhammadan states of the Dakhan
had been greatly reduced and were saved from entire
destruction by the outbreak of the fratricidal war for the
succession to the Moghul throne. For the next decade
practically, things went on as before perhaps with much
less of Musalman intervention. It was now a question
of an understanding, if not a combination, between Gingee
and Madura against Tanjore, and of the hostility of
Mysore to Madura. The wars between the last two were
carried on with a considerable amount of bitterness and
with varying success. After a decade of this warfare
the Mysoreans were so successful that it was only by
a desperate expedient that Trichinopoly could be saved
for Madura. In the course of the struggle between
these two states Madura managed to overthrow Tanjore
and let her be overthrown by the Mahrattas in turn, so
that by the time that Mysore and Madura could, after
exhausting themselves, agree to get on peacefully to-
gether, the Mahrattas had become a power in the south
to reckon with. The invasion of the Carnatic by Sivaji is
only the culminating event of the slow advance of thé
Mahrattas, where previously Bijapur invasions and occu-
pation were feared. The last decade of the century and
more, the Muhammadan states were occupied in their
death-struggle against the Moghuls under Aurangzib which
4

page 41: 26 INTRODUCTION

ended only in their extinction, and they ceased to be a
power in South Indian politics.

The fortunes of Sriranga in the meantime underwent
vicissitudes which are but vaguely reflected in the varying
combinations of his feudatories. It has already been pointed
out that the year 1646 marks in a way the formal in-
dependence of Mysore. During the next five or six years
the emperor probably tried each one of his feudatories and,
ultimately failing, made that pitiable appeal to the Moghul
emperor. Thereafter Mysore seems to have stood out as
the aggressive growing power. Ikkéri gave the asylum,
which was denied the emperor elsewhere, for some time.
His exertions were so far successful, and perhaps the
aggressions of Mysore sufficiently provocative, as to bring
about a combination of the southern states against Mysore,
the emperor being put forward as perhaps the most avail-
able element of combination among them. During the reign
of Deévarija of Mysore andin the early years of the reign
of Chikkadava Raja this combination seems to have been
kept alive, perhaps by more than one war against Mysore.
Through all these Mysore came out successful. The
decisive event of this succession of wars seems to be the
battle of Erode, which must have taken place some
time about 1672 or a little before, in which Mysore
decidedly defeated the combination and was able to occupy
the salient position along the Kongu frontier. That was
probably the last appearance of Sriranga, the emperor.
We have records of him in the Bellary District of 1662-3,
and the last record in which his name occurs is one dated
1667 in the Coimbatore District. After the battle of Erode
Ke found asylum in Ikkéri, now under the usurper Sivappa
Nayaka ; and the advance of Sivappa upon Mysore and the
victories that Mysore claimed at Sakkarepatiana and
Hassan indicate apparently the last effort on behalf of
the emperor. It may be this war in which, according

page 42: iNTRODUCTION 27

to the Raémaréjavijayamu, Kodandarama, another scion
of the Vijayanagar family and a descendant of Ramaraja
of Talikota fame, claims to have defeated the Mysore
general, the famous Dalavady Kumaraiya of this period of
Mysore history. We do not hear any more about Sriranga.
His death may have had something to do with the
coronation of Sivaji; but the latter’s march into the south
and his attempt at an assertion of his authority over the
Carnatic for which he tried so hard in 1677, must have had
at the back of it the idea that he took the place of the late
emperor of Vijayanagar. The issue of a coinage on the
model of Vijayanagar by Sivaji is a clear indication of
this. It is just possible that, as a counter-blast to
this, Aurangzib tried to assert his authority over this
same region by sending his slippers on elephant-back in
procession. The story of this peaceful mission is related
in connection with the rule of Muttu Virappa III. This
is ascribed to a period following closely upon the fall of
Bijapur and Golkonda, and may be regarded as a
characteristic attempt at the assertion of imperial authority
in the distant south, as much as Sivaji’s effort before.
The death of Sriranga and the cessation of the empire may
be dated before 1677 and after 1675, though the names of
emperors figure in records till very near 1710; and there-
after the history of South India is a history of the struggle
between the viceroys of the empire, such of them as
survived, complicated by the presence of the Mahrattas
and the advance of the Moghul generals. These latter,
in the course of the next fifty years, were able to make
themselves masters of Trichinopoly and put an end to the
Madura viceroyalty. With that ends the history of the
Nayaks of Madura, and the only other power of importance
from out of the Vijayanagar empire is the state of
Mysore, which saved itself from any Moghul conquest
under Aurangzib by a timely embassy which apparently

page 43: Q8 INTRODUCTION

Madura did not send. Mysore was allowed to pursue het
career unhampered by the Moghuls, and the dynasty that
made itself conspicuous in this period continues to rule
to-day.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTORY

THE history of the Nayaks of Madura, which comprises
roughly a period of about two hundred years, from the
second quarter of the sixteenth century down to nearly the
second half of the eighteenth century, was first presented
as 4 consecutive history by Mr. J. H. Nelson of the Madras
Civil Service in 1868, in his work The Madura Country.
He has made a careful study of the various chronicles in
Tamil and Telugu, and the inscriptions of the country so
far collected and deciphered. Further than this, he has
incorporated in his work almost all the relevant information
with regard to his subject, gleaned from the administrative
reports of the Jesuit missionary settlers in Madura,
Trichinopoly, and other places in the south, though his
work in this respect leaves much to be desired in regard to
the manner in which he has utilized these records for
historical purposes.

Nelson himself admits his difficulties in the way of
access to reliable sources in some cases, and his inability
to elucidate these sources with sufficient fulness in the
midst of his multifarious public duties, some of which were
inconsistent with the requirements of historica}] work. He
foresees the need for revision of his work and a reconsidera-
tion of his views. Apart from the accumulation of
materials, epigraphical and literary, more especially the
former, during the fifty years since its publication, his

page 45: 30 History of the Nayaks of Madura

work bears marks of having suffered much from hasty
compilation. His somewhat too exclusive reliance on Jesuit
testimony has to be modified by an impartial consideration
and collation of all accessible sources. All the recent work
of scholars, from 1900 onwards, on the history of the
Vijayanagar empire, he could not have had the benefit of,
and hence he could not attain tothe proper perspective
for the early history of this period. In spite of these
defects, some at least certainly unavoidable, his work
deserves praise as a creditable pioneer attempt at historical
construction.

The second attempt in this direction has been made by
Mr. V. Rangachari, M.A., L.T., of the Madras Department
of Education, in the Indian Antiquary (1914-17). He
has drawn upon almost all the principal original sources,
with the exception of the Jesuit letters, for the information
contained in which he relies solely on Nelson. Some
casual references of a very important character in books
not easily accessible are lost sight of, perhaps without
serious detriment to his work from this point of view. It
is only to be regretted that this work has not been noticed
critically and in detail till now.

Mr. Rangachari’s introduction to his work is on the
stupendous scale of Macaulay, and begins from 1310—-a
little before the Muhammadan conquest of Madura. He
deals at length with the Muhammadan and Vijayanagar
‘conquests, and the reigns of the Vijayanagar emperors,
Krishnadéva Raya and Achyuta Raya, which are not,
strictly speaking, germane to the subject in hand. The
general arrangement of the matter presented is defective in
parts. Questions connected with Nayak finance are dis-
cussed immediately after the beginning of Nayak rule
under Vigvanitha. Even Nelson, who deals with this
question under Tirumala Nayaka, is not free from this
charge, as he endorses the opinions of the Jesuits about the

page 46: Introductory 31

oppressive land-system of the Nayaks, though such remarks
can properly be made applicable only to the period coming
after Tirumala’s reign. Mr. Rangachari’s reflections on the
general characteristics of Nayak rule come quite at the
beginning, even before the work of the first Nayak ruler is
explained. General inferences find their proper place towards
the close, at least after the facts on which they are based are
stated. Though the chronology of the History of the
Carnataca Governors is obviously too early by a century
in the beginning, it is referred to at the commencement of
almost every reign. Selection of the right kind of sources
is an indispensable preliminary. The author constantly
refers to the curious views of Manucci, Wheeler (whom he
-calls ‘a historian with more imagination than capacity’),
and others of the kind, only to condemn them as absurd.
Detailed consideration of facts and views, which do not
come up to a minimum standard of veracity, is wasteful.
Proper canons of historical criticism are brushed aside in
Mr. Rangachari’s stigmatizing Tirumala Nayaka's negotia-
tions’ with the Muhammadans as ‘ unpatriotic’. Historical
characters must be judged according to the prevailing ideas
of their times. Moreover, ethical consideration of historical
facts is not history. The telling remark’ of Ch. V. Langlois
and Ch. Seignobos is worth remembering, at least as a check
against an excess of moral disquisitions: ‘It is not an
historian’s question, for instance, whether Napoleon was
right or wrong in his conduct at Jaffa, or Nelson in his
behaviour at Naples .. . all that the historian has to do
is to get what conclusion he can out of the conflict of
evidence’ with regard to facts. The chief characteristic of
Mr. Rangachari’s work is the encyclopedic variety of
references given, even irrespective of their merit or rele-
vancy. Some of the important references have not been

2 Introduction to the Study of History, p. xii,

page 47: 32 History of the Néyaks of Madura

made with proper care~—perhaps partly due to insufficient
proof-reading—~and they must be verified before they are
accepted. The monotony of verbiage is frequently followed
by unduly long quotations and unnecessary extracts in
extenso. Fulsome admiration and scathing condemnation
constitute, perhaps, the variety of character-study and
estimate of achievements. There is too much of ‘ cock-
sureness ’ in such expressions as ‘ the question will perhaps
be never solved’,? and in frequent and unqualified use of
such labels as ‘wrong’, ‘absurd’, ‘ridiculous’, and others
too numerous to mention. There is much evidence of a
censorial vein and want of taste in some of his remarks.
It is hardly the work of the historian to record everything
thought and said about a matter. To accumulate facts is
far easier than to weigh them and estimate them at their
real value. It is the function of properly using facts
rather than of accumulating them that distinguishes the
historian from the antiquarian. Hence it is that Lord
Acton has called for ‘ solidity of criticism’ in preference to
‘plenitude of erudition’ in the study of history. Dis-
crimination in the choice of materials and constructive
thinking are essential functions which a historian can
never abdicate. In spite of the caution given by the Rev.
William Taylor, the chronicles are taken too often at their
face value, and the whole work has the appearance of a
romance, as regards both matter and style. This is only
in conformity with his own dictum® that History, and
frequently Indian History, merges into romance. ‘

* This criticism of Mr. Rangachari’s work is allowed to pass for the
following considerations :—Mr. Rangachari’s is an elaborate work on
the subject and challenges criticism by those that take up the subject
for further researth, The criticism above has nothing personal in it,
and applies only to the published work, Almost the same opinion ot
the work was expressed by Mr, R, Sewell, the historian of Vijayanagar,

in a letter he wrote to me some time back, A review of the work at the
beginning renders it superfluous to make the constant references which

page 48: Introductory — 33

Some essays and occasional notes of varying length on
this subject, or parts thereof, owe their existence perhaps
chiefly to an effort at popularizing Nelson’s work, and
cannot, thercfore, be regarded as contributions to historical
research.

Sources.—The principal sources for the history of the
Madura Nayakship are native chronicles and memoirs,
which are a growth of later times. Though they have not
the value of contemporary evidence, they can be taken to
reflect genuine local tradition. They were apparently com-
piled with reference to the then existing records. Thus
they are at best second-hand evidence, probably too re-
mote to interfere with proper historical estimate, though
sometimes they descend to the level of bazaar gossip,
Col. Mackenzie, whose object at first was merely to collect
them, could not have exercised sufficient discriminative
judgment in recording the statements and notices he
received, and he was not spared to deal with them cri-
tically. Though some of them cannot stand even strict
internal criticism, their usefulness in investing history with
real flesh and blood cannot be overlooked; but they must
be utilized with much caution. Bishop Caldwell’s sweep-
ing condemnation, that they ‘ fall beneath the level even of
tradition’ and are ‘little better than pure inventions’,
has to be modified to a great extent. An impartial and
collated study of these native records is the only substantial
basis for the reconstruction of this history. The following
remarks of Rosebery describe our position more or less
correctly: ‘If one wishes to study seriously the life of
Napoleon at St. Helena, it is necessary first to feel one’s
way through the maze of legendary literature to arrive at
any chance or possibility of facts ; it is necessary to discard

otherwise would be inevitable and, in a case like this, undesirable,

copiously, until at last one may doubt if anything be left.
The more one reads and sifts, the more dubious become all
these chronicles, the more questionable becomes every
assertion in them.’* Though very difficult to utilize, the
native records must first be exploited for our purpose.
They are of special use, and probably almost the sole
source of information, for the sixteenth century.

Most of these chronicles were collected, translated, and
carefully edited by William Taylor in 1835 in his two
volumes of the Oriental Historical Manuscripts. His trans-
lation does not take into consideration finer shades of
meaning, and must, therefore, be frequently compared with
the original. His Catalogue Raisonne of Oriental Manu-
scripts, in three volumes published in 1857, 1860, and 1862
respectively, contains abstracts of native documents which
supply a volume of varied information. The value of
these records must be individually appraised by searching
internal and external criticism. The History of the
Carnataca Governors gives some brief, but uscful and
reliable information in spite of its strange and misleading
chronology. Its genealogical list is fuller than, and is not
opposed to, that of the other chronicles. The Mrtyun-
jaya Manuscripis and the Péndyan Chronicle are much
better in point of chronology; a better version of the
latter’ is now available than the one made use of by
Taylor. Other native manuscripts supply us with a great
deal of more or less valuable information though their
chronological value is practically little. The Tanjaviiri
Andhra Réjula Charitra similar, in the main, to the
Tanjdviri Vari Charitra of Taylor, is an illuminating
record, which bears specially on the history of Tanjore

in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but also throws
much light on Madura affairs, principally on the foundation
of the Nayakship. The Singhala dvipa catha has a very
strong air of reality about it, though it is unique in its con-
tents. Besides these there are numerous Polegar memoirs,
which throw a flood of light in unexpected nooks and
corners.

There are some literary works in Sanskrit, like the
Séhityaratnakaram, Rukminiparinayam, and others which,
though concerned primarily with the Tanjore Nayaks, in-
directly throw some light on Madura history. These works
have the merit of being almost contemporary, written by cul-
tured men who had free access to all necessary information.
Numerous other works in Sanskrit and Telugu, which deal
with the Vijayanagar empire and its rulers, contain many
references to the course of events in Madura, which was
largely influenced by this empire and its traditions even
after it had practically ceased to be controlled by it. For
the period anterior to Tirumala Nayaka, we can speak
of almost common sources for both, as during this period
Madura was a tributary of Vijayanagar. A sound know-
ledge of the history of this great empire is an essential
pre-requisite for any historical work bearing on the Nayaks
of Madura.

A particular branch of the literary sources—or rather
epistolary sources—is the series of annual reports to Europe
by the Jesuit missionaries of South India on the adminis-
tration of their various ecclesiastical centres. These reports
or letters, originally written in Italian, Portuguese, and
Latin, were translated into French by Father J. Bertrand
of the Society of Jesus, and embodied in his La Mission
du Maduré in four volumes published in Paris in 1847,

® Some of the zmportant letters bearing on political history have been

references are also rendered into English and introduced in their

1848, 1850, and 1854 respectively. The first volume is merely
introductory and gives gencral views on India and on the
Christian missions; the other volumes contain the letters
and certain documents connected with them. As coming
from educated men of high qualifications who lived in this
country and with the people, these writings arc of great
value. They throw much light on the religious, social,
economic, and political conditions of South India in the
seventeenth and a part of the cighicenth centuries. Though
their object was mainly and prolfessedly religious,
passing remarks on other aspects of society could not be
avoided. Consequently, even the historian of political
events will gain considerable material for history if he
dive deep into these documents and collect these incidental
references. In a way they serve as a necessary corrective
to the Indian tradition as embodied in the Mackenzie
Manuscripts. From 1659 to 1086 they contain a brief
sketch of the political condition of the country, apart from
casual notices of it in narrating the progress of missionary
activities. The history of the reigns of Tirumala Nayaka
and his two immediate successors, at least from 1656 to
1682, could hardly be written with sufficient fulness but
for these records.

The following observations of J. Lockman give a fair
estimate of the value of Jesuit testimony. ‘No men are
better qualified to describe nations and countrics than the
Jesuits. Their education; their extensive learning; the
pains they take to acquire the languages of the several
regions they visit; the opportunities they have, by their
skill in the arts and sciences, as well as by their insinuating
address, to glide into courts where access is often denied
to all but themselves; their familiarity with the inhabi-
tants; their mixing with, and often very long abode

page 52: Introductory 37

among, them; these must give our Jesuits a much more
perfect insight into the genius and character of a nation
than others who visit coasts only and that merely upon
account of traffic or from other lucrative motives... .
Upon the whole, therefore, the Jesuits, to speak in general,
have the best opportunity of furnishing us with valuable
accounts of many far-distant countries. Probably the
only circumstance which restrains the pens of most of them
is their profession and certain private views.’™ Father
Bertrand remarks that the chief merit of these Jesuit
letters consists in their having been written ‘ without any
thought of publication’ by men who, ‘by duty and
intimacy of confidential correspondence, offer, to their
superiors or fellow-members, a faithful picture of their
work and success, without any motive of exaggerating the
colour.’ '® But this merit seems to be of doubtful historical
value. The necessity of justifying their existence and
enhancing the importance of their labours might well have
led them, consciously or unconsciously, into exaggerations
and misstatements. Further, it does not redound much
to the veracity of an historical document that it was
‘written under the impression of the moment and inspired
by the heart’? But in cases where their evidence is of
doubtful value, it is not impossible, by a careful considera-
tion of the circumstances, to disentangle truth from its
misrepresentation or distortion. Hence a critical, an-
notated English edition of La Mission du Madurdé by a
scholar well acquainted with the history of South India in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in all its various
aspects, is a desideratum, the importance and urgency
of which can hardly be over-estimated.

The accounts given by foreign travellers, and the records

page 53: 38 History of the Na@yaks of Madura

of their travels and observations, though necessarily super-
ficial and sometimes even superfluous, have gencrally an
originality and freshness about them, The most obvious
facts about, and features of, local institutions might
naturally have been overlooked by native chroniclers.
This gap can be filled only by contemporary foreign obser-
vers. A foreign colour may be given to, and strange ideas
read into, transactions and events, which even the most
carcless native would not make a mistake about. But, in
the absence of reliable evidence, the best use will have to
be made of the distorted version. Even making allowance
for all these natural, and, 10 some extent, irremediable
defects, a foreigner’s account can smooth the angulari-
ties of native prejudice and vanity. These general merits
and defects appear, in a larger or smaller degree, according
to the ability, culture, and special circumstances of the
individual foreigner. In the present case, the accounts of
Barradas and Nuniz, the observations of John Nieuhoff
and others, the casual references of Thevenot and Manucci,
and the notices contained in Purchas’ Pilgrimes shed
welcome sidelights on many facts and events. There are
stray references to seventeenth and eighteenth century
Madura in the works of Muhammadan historians and
travellers. The records of Fort St. George are worth
ransacking, as at times we come across unexpected notices
of events.

Epigraphy is an indispensable aid to history. Generally
its evidence is contemporary and precise, and contains
much less of the personal element than is contained in
other sources. But much caution has to be exercised in
dealing with the materials ,it affords. Allowance has to be
made for royal and governmental rodomontade, and
spurious or forged plates have to be guarded against.
Though used with the greatest discrimination, this source
can only furnish very general and meagre information as

page 54: Introductory 39

genealogical lists, chronological details, and disconnected
facts. Inscriptions per se cannot claim any invariable
superiority over the literary sources ; they are a necessary
and useful supplement tothem. They can only give us
dry bones of history ; it is the function of literary accounts
to make them real and living. Nelgon had only a handful
of s¢sanams and other epigraphical records, but our posi-
tion now is much better, though there 1s, as yet, no risk of
superfluity. Almost all the epigraphical information now
available for our period is collected in Sewell’s Lists of
Antiquities, Madras, the annual reports of the Madras
Department of Epigraphy, the Travancore Archeological
Series, Burgess and Natesa Sastri’s Tamil and Sanskrit
Inscriptions, and other minor publications.

The archeological remains of the Nayak rule are found
chiefly in the districts of Madura, Tinnevelly, Ramnad, and
Trichinopoly. The town of Madura and its environs
especially supply us with much of antiquarian interest.
The public buildings have their own story to tell. The
numerous place-names bear the impress of Nayak associa-
tions. A good local knowledge of the southern districts
is a great help to the elucidation of old records.

Besides these original sources, very reliable second-
hand information is available in the works of Robert Orme
and F. C. Danvers. All these materials enable us to give
a connected account of the Nayak regime, though much
has still to be left to future historical research. It has not
been possible in this work to utilize historical information
that may be found in Telugu Literature beyond what is
contained in Professor S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar’s Sources
of Vijayanagar History.

Date of the Foundation of the Nayakship.-—Tradition is
almost unanimous in ascribing the foundation of Nayak
rule in Madura to Vigvanitha Nayaka, the son of Nagama
Nayaka of the Kagyapa-gotra. Inscriptions also lend their

page 55: 40 History of the Ndyaks of Madura

support to this view. The Dalavay Agraharam Plates of
Venkata I say that Virabhipa (Virappa Nayaka) was born
in the family of Vigvanatha Nayaka. The Kiniyfir Plates
of Venkata II, which trace the ancestry of Tirumala
Nayaka, begin with Vigvanitha. The latier’s name is
found tacked on to the names of many of the Nayaks in
their inscriptions. Chokkanatha almost invariably appears
as Visvanatha-Chokkanatha.

But the date of the commencement of Vidévanatha
Nayaka’s vicercyaliy of Madura and its duration are
differently given in the native chronicles; and there is
not, as yet, a consensus of opinion among scholars on this
important question. The theory of Nelson, borrowed by
R. Sewell and accepted by Rao Bahadur H. Krishna Sastri,“4
now Epigraphist to the Government of India, places
Vigvanitha’s assumption of power in 1559. This view
seems to be partly the result of reliance on later tradition
as embodied in the Pdndyan Chronicle and Mrltyunjaya
Manuscripts, either of which, it scems, Nelson™ is dis-
posed to call ‘the most trustworthy of the manuscripts
translated by Taylor’. The latter chronicle refers only
to the date of the crowning of Visvanatha, not to his
accession to power. It is clear from the account it gives
that he was anointed after much of his work in Madura
was done. Perhaps Nelson was also led away by the fact
that there were no inscriptions of Visvandtha prior to 1560,
at the time he wrote. He does not discuss the question
fully, but satisfies himself with the assurance that ‘1559
is the correct date of Vigvanatha’s assumption of govern-
ment’... . ‘the accuracy of which there oan be no reason
to doubt’.

Mr. Rangachari has attempted to discuss this ques-
tion, but with no better result. He stops short with the

* Archeological Survey of India, Report, 1911-12, p. 194.
p. 87.

page 56: Introductory 41

dogmatic assertion that ‘inscriptions unmistakably prove
that it was 1559’. He seems to rely ona misreading of
the title ‘ Pandyakulasthapanacharya’ in the Krishna-
puram Plates of Sadasiva (1567) as referring to Nagama
Nayaka, to establish the fact that the latter was one of the
principal commanders of Vijayanagar in Achyuta Raya’s
Travancore campaign of 1532-3." Therefore, he argues
that Nagama could not have revolted before 1535. Nor
could he have done so, he continues, during the period
1535-57, when Vigsvanatha and Vitthala were Vijayanagar
viceroys in the south; for the former was his son and the
latter his relative. ‘If Nagama Naik’s revolt had taken
place during the administration of these viceroys, it would
certainly have been recorded in some at least of the in-
scriptions of the day.’ Hence Mr. Rangachari’s conclusion
that ‘ Nagama’s defection must have taken place in 1557
or 1558, and that his defeat and his son’s elevation must
have been accomplished in 1559'. He himself seems to
contradict this view when he says, in another connection,
that ‘it is possible, nay probable, that he (Nagama) died
earlier (than 1558)’. Further, his argument from silence,
viz., the absence of inscriptions of Nagama’s revolt between
1535 and 1557, is fallacious, and must apply equally well
to the tithe he ascribes to it. His revolt is recorded in no
inscription. With regard to the title attributed to Nagama
to prove his loyalty in 1532-3, it does not refer to him
but to his grandson, Krishnappa Nayaka, as is evident
from the following verses from the Krishnapuram Plates of
Sadasiva.” ;

If Nagama had been a commander of Achyuta, it is likely
to have been recorded, if not in inscriptions, at least in the
Achyutarayabhyudayam, which deals directly with the
latter’s Travancore campaign. However, Mr. Rangachari
remarks: ‘It is curious that Mr. Krishna Sastri totally
ignores Nagama’s part in this campaign.’ ”

Taylor himself, on a reconsideration of this question,
was for placing Nagama’s revolt about twenty years earlier,
i.e. about 1538; but his object was to allow some inter-
val between that event and Visvanatha’s assumption of
authority. Wilks ™ dates the foundation of the Nayakship
of Madura in 1532. Caldwell advanced a strong plea for
revision of Nelson’s date, and suggested 1520.% Thus long
ago the necessity for correcting this dating, i.e. 1559, was
strongly felt by scholars. The crux of the question of the
foundation of the Nayakship is in the revolt of Nagama
Nayaka against the orders of the Vijayanagar emperor ;
for his revolt and Vigvandtha’s viccroyalty are too closely
associated in tradition to be doubted, at least in the
present state of our epigraphical and historical knowledge.

The untenability of the date 1557-8 for Nigama’s defi-
ance of imperial authority is clear from a careful study of
inscriptions and other sources of information. He is
mentioned in an inscription, dated 1484," as the * foremost
servant’ of the Vijayanagar emperor, Saluva Narasinga I.
If at least a life of thirty or thirty-five years is allowed for
one to reach such a high position, Nagama would be nearly
110 years old at the time ascribed for his revolt. The
identity of the Nagama of this inscription with the Nagama
of the Madura chronicles, the father of Visgvandtha, is
‘not unlikely’ in Mr. Krishna. Sastri’s opinion, which is
endorsed by Mr. Rangachari. Further, there is sufficient

evidence to show that Sevvappa Nayaka was established
in Tanjore at least by 1549.% This event may have been
even earlier, since Achyuta Raya must have died about
1541, and he is said to have given Tanjore as dowry to his
sister-in-law, Mirtimaimbal, whom Sevvappa married.”
Since Nagama’s revolt was posterior to, and indirectly the
result of, the aggressions of a king of Tanjore against a
Pandya king, such a course of events could not be
ascribed, in any case, to a period later than 1549, as already
indicated. Further, Nagama could not have revolted in
the reign of Achyuta Raya. As has been shown before,
there appears to be no support, either epigraphical or
literary, for the view that he was an officer of the latter
in the conduct of the Travancore campaign. From the
chronicles it is clear that he was a distinguished officer
(viceroy or general revenue officer) with the control of the
whole south under him and entrusted with large responsi-
bilities before his revolt. Such an exalted office was
held, under Achyuta Raya, by Salakraju Timmarazu, and
afterwards by Vitthala. Hence Nagama’s revolt must be
ascribed to a period earlier than the commencement of
Achyuta Raya’s reign, ie. to the reign of Krishnadéva
Raya.

Caldwell’s dating (1520) seems to be a little too early.
After the victory of Raichur, Krishnadéva Raya was at
ease for some time. He seems to have been perfectly
free from troubles till about 1525. His last years were by
no means a period of tranquillity, as is evident from the
account of Nuniz and some epigraphical records. This
Portuguese chronicler says® that the king’s health was a
source of anxiety to him and that he even abdicated in
favour of his son, who was about six years old. The latter

soon died, and the king believed that he was poisoned by
his minister. In the same period troubles were created by
a responsible and powerful officer of the king, Vira
Narasimha, the governor of the Chola country, as is
known from the Achyutardydbhyudayam ™ and his inscrip-
tions, the last of which belongs to 1528. Perhaps
Nagama’s resolution to disobey the king was partly
influenced by the attitude of this governor and by the
state of affairs in the capital. Thus the last few years of
Krishnadéva Raya’s reign indicate a time when Nagama’s
rebellion might well have taken place.

Our whole position with regard to the date of the founda-
tion of the Nayakship of Madura is strengthened by the
clear and straightforward account given in the Tanjéviiri
Andhra Rajula Charitra™ The Chola aggression against
the Pandya, the latter's appeal to the Raya, Nagama's depu-
tation to settle the troubles, his usurpation, Visvandtha's
successful action against him, finally Nagama’s pardon, and
Jater on Visvanatha’s appointment as viceroy of Madura
are placed in the reign of Krishnadéva Raya. It is said
that the Raya died some time after Vigvanatha had
exercised his new authority for the improvement of the
kingdom. The facts contained in this account, which are
capable of verification, are so singularly correct that the
whole narrative compels conviction as a faithful description
of the transactions.

All that we know of Vigvanadtha Nayaka from inscrip-
tions, chronicles, and other sources further confirms our
contention that the Nayakship of Madura under him was
an accomplished fact before the death of Krishyadéva Raya
in 1530. There are inscriptions from which his position as
ruler of Madura becomes clear. No. 14 of Appendix A,

of the same year * mention the defeat of the Tiruvadi, the
Pandya king, and other kings or chiefs, and the annexation
of their dominions as the achievements of Vigvanatha; and
speak of his acquiring sovereignty over Madhura-rdjya by
his own prowess. This information is indirectly confirmed
bygthe Krishnapuram Plates of Sadagiva. No. 17 of 1912,
dated Krédhana (1565), says that he acquired the Tiruvadi-
desa as amarandyakam (military fief) from Ramaraja Aiyan.
From all these it is evident that such a control over.
Travancore -he could not have had without authority in
Madura. The events referred to above came out of Achyuta
Raya’s Travancore campaign, which seems to have been
undertaken to remove the disturbances following in the train
of the establishment of the Nayakship of Madura. We have
no evidence to believe that Visvanatha accompanied the
Vijayanagar army from the capital, and this leads to the
inference that he was already in Madura. His co-operation
with Achyuta’s generals in this campaign is reflected in 113
of 1908, dated 1535,* which records the gift of a village by
Achyuta for the merit of Vigvanatha Nayaka, who is spoken
of as his agent.

A careful study of the chronicles reveals the fact that
Vigvanatha’s elevation to the viceroyalty happened not long
after his distinguishing himself in the northern campaigns
of the sovereign of Vijayanagar, and that it was due to the
same king, whom he had served so well in the north. If
we read the accounts of Barradas and Nuniz together, it is
sufficiently clear that Vigvanatha took part in the Raichar
campaign of Krishnadéva Raya. The latter authority says
that ‘the page who served the King with betel had fifteen
thousand foot and two hundred horse, but he had no
elephants’; ** the former speaks of ‘the great Naique of
Madura—a page of the betel to the King of Bisnaga’.** This

page 61: 46 History of the Ndyaks of Madura

‘page of the betel’, who is said to have taken part in the
above-mentioned campaign, must be either Nagama Nayaka
or, better, his son Visvanatha. The former was too great
and too old to go on active service at that time; the latter,
being then young and handsome, might well have served
the king in that capacity in lien of the father. The
Mrtyunjaya Manuscripts say that Visvanatha used to
accompany the king in his bunt when he was sixteen years
of age. The History of the Carnataca Governors records
that he was sent by him to subdue some inferior princes in
the north. The extravagant claim made by the former*
chronicle that he subdued ‘the Anga, Vanga, Calinga,
Cashmira, and Nepala countries’ may be understood as
an lexaggeration of his share in the king’s campaigns in Orissa
and other places. There was scope for these achievements
only in the reign of Krishnadéva Riya. The concurrent
testimony of all the available evidence goes to prove that
Vigvanatha played a prominent part in Krishna's cam-
paigns against the king of Orissa and the Muhammadans,
and that it was to him he owed his viceroyalty of Madura.

The question of the duration of his viceroyalty throws
some light on its commencement. According to the
Pandyan chronicle, it was about two years and four months.
This period is evidently too short for the conquest and
settlement of the country attributed to him. The History
of the Carnaiaca Governors says that he ruled for twenty-six
‘years after the organization of the Pilaiyam system.
The Supplementary Manuscript gives a total duration of
twenty-six years ; the Maduraittalavaralaru, about twenty-
two years and a half in all, making him viceroy in three
different periods. From the account of Ramabhadra
Nayaka of Periyakulam” it is clear that Vidvanatha lived for
more than twenty years after the reduction of the Kambam

8” Taylor, C.A., ii, pp. 876-8,

page 62: Introductory 47

country and the erection of seventy-two bastions to the
Madura fort. These considerations show the utter futility
of clinging to the theory of Nelson and his followers.
Almost all the chronicles speak of Vigvanatha’s rule be-
tween 1535 and 1544 (nine years) as his first viceroyalty,
and again refer to his holding the same authority in 1545-6
for about one year. Mr. Rangachari accepts this position,
but does not explain the interval. Was Visvandtha super-
seded or deputed elsewhere? The only probable explanation
is that he was all along ruler of Madura, from the time
of his appointment by Krishnadéva Raya. The nature of
the times, and consequently the work he had to do, perhaps
required his absence from Madura; and most probably the
local chroniclers have put down his deputies as viceroys.
Such an arrangement was prevalent in other parts of the
Vijayanagar empire. To casual observers, the local rulers,
for the time being, might appear to be real governors or
viceroys. Vigvanatha’s viceroyalty seems to have been
continuous, though he may not have been in Madura
throughout.

Finally, there is a reference in John Nieuhoff, * which
confirms the chronological re-adjustment elaborated in this
investigation. With regard to the events of 1533, he says:
‘ After all, the Nayk of Madure, having found means to
get into the possession of this country, left the Portuguese
in the full possession of their jurisdiction over the Parvas,
and of the free exercise of their religion.’ This discussion
leads to the conclusion that Vigvanatha Nayaka, the
founder of the Nayak dynasty of Madura, was established in
authority there not long before the death of the Vijayanagar
emperor, Krishnadéva Raya, in 1530, i.e, about 1529.

VISVANATHA NAYAKA AND THE
FOUNDATION OF THE NAYAKSHIP

(c. 1529-1564)

NAGAMA NAYAKA was one of the trusted officers of
Krishnadéva Raya. He is variously described in the
chronicles as his general, store-keeper (hence his title
Katiya), treasurer (Tosekhdna Adhikdri), chief revenue
officer, and viceroy of the south. It is, however, clear that
he was responsible for the general supervision of the ad-
ministration of the southern provinces. In this capacity
he had probably control over a portion of the king’s army,
besides his own forces. Such an exalted charge entrusted
to Nagama can be explained only by his antecedents.
Inscriptions speak of him as a prominent figure in the
previous reigns. He was the ‘foremost servant’ of Saluva
Narasinga and had agents under him.' He seems to
have had much to do with the establishment of the Tuluva
dynasty. The services of such a person Krishnadeva
Raya retained, as was usual with wise kings in the case of
their predecessors’ devoted officers.

Nagama’s pilgrimage to Benares is narrated in detail by
the chronicles ; and he is said to have entrusted his office to
Ramabhadra Nayaka in his absence. Whether he really
undertook this distant and difficult journey or not, it is
evident that want of male issue to perpetuate his family
made him devote much time and labour in offering prayers

1 Appendix D, Nos, 4 and 2.

page 64: Visvandtha Ndyaka 49

to God Visvanatha of Benares. The Kiniyir Plates of
Venkata II seem to suggest that Vigvanatha’s birth was
due to the severe austerities of his father and the favour of
God Visvégvara. The date of this event is not definitely
known. Since the chronicles say that Visvanatha was
about sixteen when he was introduced to Krishnadéva Raya,
he may have been born about 1495,

As has already been remarked, Vigsvanaitha appears to
have entered the service of the king as his ‘ betel-bearer ’.
The experienced and far-seeing Nagama would have spared
no pains to perfect his son’s natural endowments. So
Vigvanatha easily became one of the king’s personal
attendants. His handsome appearance, careful education,
and manly courage enabled him to rise higher and higher
in the estimation of the Raya. He seems to have accom-
panied him in his expedition against the king of Orissa.
Perhaps his devoted service in this campaign gained him
the command of a battalion in the attack on, and capture
of, Raichir in 1520, When he was thus at the height of
his fame and established in the king’s confidence, he was
deputed to the south to perform a delicate and difficult task.

The course of events leading to Krishnadéva Raya’s
interference in the affairs of his southern kingdom during
the last years of his reign is clouded by the mists of
tradition, and nothing certain can be said at present about
the precise nature of the transactions that required his
attention. It is said that a Chola king, Vira Sekhara,
invaded the Pandya country, and dispossessed its king,
Chandra Sékhara, of his kingdom. Consequently the latter
appealed to the Raya for justice and for help in getting back
his kingdom from the usurper. Though the whole country
as far south as Cape Comorin formed part of the Vijayanagar
empire, the old rulers were not done away with, and there
were petty Pandya and Chola descendants ruling nominally
in parts of their ancestral territories. But the emperor could

7

page 65: 50 History of the Nayaks of Madura

not tolerate aggressive war between two of his feudatories,
and he instantly organized the necessary expedition. As an
officer responsible for the peace of the south, Nagama,
who was probably at headquarters then, was sent to
remedy the injustice complained of by the Pandya, and
put him in possession of his kingdom. Ina short time, he
defeated the Chola and deprived him of his acquisitions.
The other part of his commission, viz., the restoration of
the Pandya, he hesitated to execute. The recent troubles
may have led him to a revision of the arrangements
for the government of the country. To him order and
security was everything, and he seems to have sacri-
ficed all for it. He was a masterful personality and a
thorough-going administrator ; and he would not perpetuate
an arrangement which inevitably called for interference
from the higher authorities. He may have realized that
the previous arrangement of propping up petty and in-
capable rulers to satisfy their sentiments had failed, and
that a drastic reorganization was necessary for the peaceful
progress of the country. His dealings with the Pandya
are not sufficiently clear; but disagreements arose between
them, which were brought to the notice of the emperor
by the Pandya as a charge against him. Some chronicles,
which are brief about this transaction, speak of the sudden
disobedience of Nagama, and the speedy punishment
which the Raya meted out to him. But the Tanjaviiri
Andhra Rajula Charitra, which details the circumstances,
explains Nagama’s position better. He set forth his views
in a strongly-worded note to the emperor. When he saw
that the Pandya was bent on going direct to the latter
to complain, perhaps fearing misrepresentation of his
attitude, he sent his faithful servant, Ramabhadra Nayaka,
to headquarters. At last, when the emperor was prepared,
at any cost, to restore the Pandya and continue the old
atrangement, subversive of peace and order, perhaps

page 66: Visvanatha Néyaka 51

unmindful of or not knowing fully the real state of affairs
in the south, and unwilling to take any new step in his
anxious days, Nagama put on a bold front, and probably
thought that he could bring him round later on to his way
of looking at things. The Raya’s subsequent action may
well have upset him.

It is said that Krishnadéva Raya was much enraged at
Nagama’s insubordination, and appealed to his officers as to
who among them would volunteer to punish the rebel.
Only Visvanatha, the latter’s son, responded to this call;
and, after some hesitation on the part of the Raya, he was
sent with a large army to deal with him. Negotiations
failing, a battle is said to have been fought, and Nagama
brought as a captive to the emperor, who, in consideration
of Vigvanatha’s unique and extraordinarily loyal sense of
duty to him, forgave his father. The whole story has a
very romantic colouring. Most probably Nagama was
recalled from the south through the diplomatic offices of
his son. Perhaps he yielded to the wishes of his very
affectionate son with the idea of retiring from the king’s
service. After this nothing is known about him; the
chronicles have nothing to say about his subsequent life or
death.

Conferring with the Pandya, and learning more about
the real facts from Nagama, the emperor realized that
only the latter's solution of the question was workable,
since the former plainly admitted his inability to restore
order in the country, and govern the intractable chiefs,
So Vigvanitha was appointed Viceroy of the South with
the titles, Chief of the Pandya Country and Lord of the
Southern Throne. .

Vigvanitha left Vijayanagar with a strong army to tak
charge of his office. On reaching Madura, he was not
satisfied with the condition of its fort. With the co-
operation of Ariyanatha, his Dalavay and Pradhayi, and

page 67:  

52 History of the Nayaks of Madura

Kégavappa Nayaka, he reconstructed the fort with bastions,
and built temples for God Sundara and Goddess Minikshi.
His schemes for the improvement of the country were out
of all proportion to its resources, and he is said, with a
rare sense of public duty and generosity, to have lavishly
spent his father’s treasures on works of public utility.
Meanwhile, according to the chronicles, the Pandya race
became extinct, and Visvanatha became the sole ruler of
the country. This extinction may have reference to
Chandra Sékhara Pandya and his family, not to the
Pandyas of Tenkasi, as the former is mentioned as the
Pandya ruler and his illegitimacy is said to have been the
cause of the Chola aggression.

Visgvanatha seems at first to have been the viceroy of
the Chola country also. Some time after he had made
preliminary arrangements for the administration of the
kingdom, Krishnadéva Raya died (530) and was succeeded
by his younger brother, Achyuta Raya. Shortly after, the
Chola country was separated [rom the viceroyalty of
Madura, and entrusted to Sevvappa Nayaka, the husband
of the younger sister of Achyuta Riya’s wife, Tirumalambi.
Perhaps as a result of this new arrangement, Trichinopoly
went to Madura and Vallam to Tanjore. This is spoken
of by the chronicles as the exchange of these two places
by Viévanatha and the king of Tanjore. Evidently it must
have been an imperial arrangement, not a mutual exchange
as is suggested; for the empire was yet too strong to
allow so much independence to the provinces.

Visvanaitha seems to have taken the earliest opportunity
ta provide for the safety of Trichinopoly. The robber
pest was first dealt with successfully. The jungles on
both sides of the Kaveri were cleared, and thus the dens
of robbers completely destroyed. The necessary police
arrangements were made to safeguard the life and property
of the pilgrims. The town was fortified, and a. double wall

page 68: Visvandtha Néyaka 53

and a big ditch were constructed round it. He paid
particular attention to the temples of Trichinopoly and
Stirangam, and the Teppakulam seems to owe its existence
to him. It is not likely that he built the Srirangam
temple, as is said in the chronicles; probably he ordered
extensive repairs and the erection of some new structures,
The Kéyiloluhu records that he spent about three lakhs of
pons for the temple. He seems to have built many houses,
and encouraged habitation all around.

While Visvanatha was engaged in the north, his general
and co-adjutor, Ariyandtha, was sent to the far south, the
Tinnevelly country, to restore peace and order there. His
task was by no means easy. He was faced with the
hostility of the minor chiefs who had strongly organized
themselves in the country round ‘ Kayattattir’, ready
to give battle, and who were prepared to acknowledge
‘no earthly superior’. These called themselves ‘ Pancha
Pandyas’ (the Five Pandyas), but, according to some
chronicles, they were the tributaries of the old Pandyas; and,
according to others, the illegitimate sons of the grandfather
of Chandra Sékhara. The inscriptions of the later Pandyas
are conspicuous by their almost total absence in the
Madura district even in the fifteenth century. Vijayanagar
expansion to the south may have driven them to a corner
farther south. There seems to have been no legitimate
Pandya king in Madura in the sixteenth century. The
withdrawal of the real Pandyas to the environs of Tenkagi
perhaps brought into existence in Madura many illegiti-
mate claimants, mutually questioning their legitimacy.
Ariyanatha had to subdue such illegitimate Pandyas,
or refractory vassals of the old rulers, who would not
acquiesce ‘in foreign rule, which was trying to establish
a systematic and vigorous government, without a hard
struggle. His conciliatory methods failed; and he seems
to have been repulsed by them, when he requisitioned the

page 69: 54 History of the Nayaks of Madura

help of Vigvanitha, who is said to have brought them
round finally by his chivalry. Most probably a compromise
was arrived at, and the minor chiefs were conciliated by
their inclusion in his PaJaiyam System.

It is not clear whether Achyuta Raya’s Travancore
campaign was undertaken in connection with this arrange-
ment. Perhaps the old Pandyas, who had retired to Tenkagi,
instigated all this disaffection against the Madura ruler.
In any case, this campaign was meant to put down all
trouble from the Tiruvadi, who seems to have harboured
enemies of Vijayanagar. Its successful conclusion removed
for the time being all source of trouble for Visvanatha. It
appears that the Tenkasi Pandyas became feudatory to
Madura, and, to cement the alliance probably, a Pandya
princess is said to have been given in marriage to Achyuta
Raya.” The Tiruvadi also became a tributary, and this
is confirmed by the Suchindram inscription of Bhitalavira
Rama Varman.’ Therefore imperial intervention seems to
have been required for the final settlement of Tinnevelly.
It is difficult to believe that Vigvanatha achieved alone what
was impossible for Ariyanatha and his army, as is main-
tained by the chronicles, which give a highly romantic and
unconvincing account. The whole transaction connected
with Achyuta’s southern campaign clearly shows that
Vigvanatha, though ruler of Madura, only occupied a very
subordinate position with regard to the generals of the
Empire. From the Krishnipuram Plates of Sad&giva it
appears that Krishnappa Nayaka, the son of Visvanitha,
played a prominent part in this affair.

Soon after the conquest of Tinnevelly, Visvandtha and
Ariyanitha concerned themselves with the improvement
of the country. The town of Tinnevelly was much
enlarged and improved ; temples were erected, villages and

#49 and 50 of 1900; 4/.2.22,, 1900, p. 27.
° Appendix D, No. 26,

page 70: Visvandtha Nédyaka 55

Streets opened, and every convenience of the inhabitants
looked after. Agricultural interests were specially con-
sidered, and irrigation schemes were undertaken. Every
inducement was given for bringing the whole country under
cultivation. Everywhere foundations of peace and orderly
administration were laid, and the advantages of beneficent
rule extended.

Before Vigvanatha could bring the country under a
regular system of administration, he had to undertake a
military expedition against the Kambam-Gidalir country,
which ceased to pay tribute owing to its capture, it is said,
by the Chola king. Perhaps some dispossessed and discon-
tented chief created trouble in that almost inaccessible
place, by tracing his ancestry to the Cholas. Visvanatha
summoned his military officers, and gave the command to
Ramabhadra Nayaka, his father’s faithful subordinate, who
is said to have successfully stormed the fort of Kambam,
and reduced the country to submission. For his long and
faithful services, Vidvanatha gave him the Palaiyam of
Vadakarai on the northern bank of the Vaigai.

Extent of the Kingdom.—The Mrtyunjaya Manuscripts
say that, ‘ while (Ariyanadtha was) discharging the duties of
both these responsible stations (Dalavay and°Pradhani), the
extent of country acquired was from Utatur (Orrattir) and
Valikondapuram on the north, even to Caniya Cumari
(Cape Comorin) on the south; to Coyambutur (Coimbatore),
Ivodu (Erode), Taraburam (Dharapuram), and Mele Mali
(Méla Malai, Western Ghats) onthe west; to Ramiseram
(Ramégvaram) and the sea on the east. This translation
by Taylor has been taken by Nelson to mean, the extent
of the country on Ariyanitha’s death in 1600. But the
original Tamil passage® is to the effect that these were the
boundaries of the kingdom under Visvanatha. Taylor

Taylor.C.&., ili, p. 377.
5 Jbid,, O. A. uss. ii, p. 117, ® Jbid., p. 118,

page 71: 56 History of the Ndyaks of Madura

takes the clause referring to the latter as qualifying
Ariyanatha, and this interpretation is against the obvious
sense of the passage. Further, this description of the ex-
tent of the kingdom appears in dealing with Vidvanitha.
It can only mean that, when Ariyanatha was holding the
seals of the two offices mentioned, Visvandtha’s kingdom
had these limits. .
From the account of the chronicle, it appears that,
before the death of Vigvanatha, the kingdom of Madura
comprised roughly, in modern terminology, the districts
of Madura, Ramnad, Tinnevelly, Trichinopoly, Coimbatore,
and Salem, and a part of Travancore. The career of
Vigvanatha, so far described, makes it clear that the
Pandyan kingdom and a part of the Chola dominions
came under his authority. The real question is whether
Coimbatore and Salem were subordinate to him. We
learn from the Jesuit letters that they were under Madura
in the time of Tirumala Nayaka. Inscriptions also confirm
this. There appears to be no mention in chronicles or
inscriptions that they were conquered by any of his prede-
cessors, Sixteenth century epigraphical records of the
Vijayanagar emperors are largely found in these districts.
There is no déubt that they formed part of the Vijayanagar
empire. Under these circumstances, it is probable that
they were included in the Madura viceroyalty even at the
commencement of the Nayakship. It is likely that the
title of Visvanatha ‘ Lord of the Southern Throne’ was some-
thing more than a mere name, even though the Madura
Nayaks are not often mentioned in the inscriptions of the
sixteenth century in these districts. It is clear, however, that
the maximum extent of the Nayak dominions was reached
before Vigvandtha’s death. His successors had only to see
to the integrity of the kingdom, and keep it free from the
aggression of neighbours and foreigners. Mr. Rangachari
is not clear with regard to Visvanatha’s dealings with

page 72: Visvandtha Naéyaka 37

Coimbatore and Salem, whether he had to conquer them
or simply to accept their loyalty. He seems to include
them amongst his conquests.’

While Vigvanatha’s authority was recognized in all these
territories, his practical control over them seems to have
varied. Coimbatore and Salem do not appear to have
received his attention as much as the other parts. The
frontiers on that side became important only later on, when
Mysore became independent and aggressive. It may be
doubted whether the same system of administration was
organized in them as in the other parts of the kingdom.
It is probable that large tracts of the country were en-
trusted to powerful chiefs, who had only to pay tribute
regularly to be left to themselves. With regard to the
coast region, not only Visgvanatha, but his successors also,
seem to have left it under the administration of the com-
mercial nations of the West, and satistied themselves with
mere tribute.*

Such an extensive kingdom seems to have been protected
by a regular system of fortifications, not only on the
frontiers but also in the interior. The chronicles give a
long list of forts built by the Nayaks.’ It is difficult to
say what Vigvanatha’s share actually was. Mr. Rangachari
gives him the whole credit for the organization of the
defence of the kingdom. In the early days of the Nayak-
ship, there was practically no fear of aggression from any-
where. After the battle of Talikota, disorganization set
in, and the various provinces of the Empire felt the
necessity of looking after their own defence. In the case
of Madura, foreign aggression came only in the seventeenth
century. Therefore, what little Visvanatha might have
done for defence would not have been sufficient in later
times ; he could not have seen so far ahead.

page 73: 58 History of the Ndyaks of Madura

Organization of the Pdlaiyams.—Aftcr restoring peace
and order, Vigvanatha and Ariyanatha organized the whole
country for effective administration. They had to take
into account the old local chieftains who were the vassals
of the Pandyas, the emigrants from the north who had
left their country cither owing to the Muhammadan peril
or in quest of ‘pastures new’, and their own faithful
followers; and incorporate them all into a system of
government, which would conduce to the peace and pros-
petity of the country. Agriculture was in a languishing
condition; the land was mostly covered with forests,
which endangered the safety and welfare of the people in
many ways; and disorganization was prevalent every-
where. Under these circumstances, the central govern-
ment by itself could not do much, without entrusting large
power and freedom of action to local authorities. The
adventurous spirit of the new-comers could well be diverted
into peaceful activities if their ideas of sclf-importance
were respected. Further, the defence of the country must
be effectively provided for, to make united action possible
in times of danger. Such political, economic, and military
motives probably influenced Visvanatha and Ariyandtha in
instituting what is called the Palaiyam System.

The chronicles speak of the division of the country into
seventy-two Palaiyams, and of each Palaiyakiran or Polegar,
the chief holding one of them, being responsible for the
defence of one of the seventy-two bastions of the Madura
fort. It is not definitely known how many Palaiyams were
originally constituted by Visvanatha, and whether others
were not created by his successors. Later on, we find the
confiscation of some of them. Perhaps these seventy-two
were the survivals, taken into account by lator tradition as
contained in the chronicles. It ig likely that more were
created at first, considering the clamant demands of
Vigvanatha’s multitudinous followers, and the arduous

page 74: Visvandtha Nayaka 59

nature of the improvements to be effected in the country.
Moreover, Dindigul alone is said to have consisted of about
eighteen Palaiyams, and it was too small in extent to re-
present one-fourth of the whole kingdom. Anyhow, it is
hard to believe that the number of the Palaiyams created
in the beginning remained the same to the end of the
Nayak regime.

Visvanatha’a arrangement in this respect was a practical
solution of the difficulties he was confronted with. He
pacified his clamorous adherents and old, discontented
chiefs by conferring on them a dignified status and definite
proprietary rights over portions of land. By making the
cession hereditary their self-love was flattered and their
sense of responsibility increased. They were given com-
plete powers of police and judicial administration. For
good or for evil, they were masters in their small sphere.
In return for this, they were to pay a tribute to the Nayak
of one-third of their income from land, and maintain, with
another third part, the troops which their master would
require in case of war. Practically they could enjoy more
than one-third of their revenues. Further, liberal con-
cessions in the tribute were allowed for loyal and public
services, sometimes even to the extent of the whole amount.

The status and power of the various Polegars could not
have been the samc; it is extremely unlikely that all of
them had equally good record of past services and equal
possessions. In course of time at least, there would have
been changes in their attitude and position. Consequently
their obligations would have been different. Vico’s letter of
1611* says that ‘ Hermécatte’ (Erumaikatti), a powerful
Polegar, very influential at court, ‘has domains enough to
be obliged to maintain for the Nayak’s service three thousand
infantry, two hundred horses and fifty elephants’.

Thus the country was organized on a military basis.
That the system could not, and did not, satisfy all, is
evident from the rebellion which Vigvanatha’s son had to
deal with at the very commencement of his reign. But it
was acceptable to most of the Polegars, as their loyalty did
not fail for a very long time. This institution satistied the
requirements of the time ; peace and order was established
on a firm basis, and the country took rapid strides in agri-
cultural improvement. Forests were cleared, and much
waste land was brought under cultivation. The system
was a good safeguard against foreign invasion and espc-
cially against foreign occupation. Madura did not share the
fate of Gingi and Tanjore so long as it worked on right
lines. The ‘ Polygar Wars’, which preceded the establish-
ment of the British Collectorate, show its vitality in its
best days. Though life might be suspended at one blow in
the centre, it could still pulsate with vigour in all the
vatious parts, The complete conquest and subjugation of
Madura would mean the separate conquest of all the
Palaiyams. But the system contained within itself the
seeds of its decay. Everything depended on an overlord
who could constantly keep the turbulent chicfs in good
humour, and on the good sense of ihe latter. If it were to
degenerate, as it did later on, it could be the most potent
engine of oppression and disorder. But at the time it was
originated, no alternative was possible. It could have been
improved later on when it showed signs of weakness, but
no ruler felt called upon to keep its retrogressive tendencies
in check. At last it weakened the central power and
invited its own doom along with that of the other. A. J.
Stuart” gives a qualified defence of this institution, but
his European feudal analogy cannot be pressed except in a
very general way. Bishop Caldwell®™ is not ina mood to

appreciate its good side; he condemns the experiment out-
right, but does not suggest any alternative possible at that
time. Nelson® is disposed to think that the scheme was as
good as any that could be devised at such a time. Though
the names of both Visvanitha and Ariyanatha are mentioned
in some chronicles in connection with the organization of
the Palaiyam System, others seem to credit its origination
and application solely to the latter. It is true that the
Polegars were specially attached to Ariyanatha and his name.
It is likely that Visvanatha entrusted his faithful officer and
co-worker with the practical working out of the scheme,
though it is difficult to assign its conception to either of
them exclusively.

The question as to when the country was organized into
Palaiyams is difficult to solve definitely. Nelson’ says that
shortly after this work, Visvanatha died; he therefore
ascribes it to about 1563. The History of the Carnataca
Governors records that Visvanatha ruled for twenty-six
years after this settlement. This puts the Palaiyam
organization about 1538. The account of Ramabhadra
Nayaka, given by Taylor," referring to the Vadakarai
Palaiyam, says that he enjoyed it for twenty years and
died, and that his death was deplored by Visvanitha.,
Thus the latter authority tends to confirm the statement of
the former chronicle. If this Ramabhadra Nayaka is the
Ramappa Nayaka of the inscriptions, the period of twenty
years referred to will have to be between c. 1535 and 1552;
for the latter’s epigraphical records range between these
two dates. The evidence of inscriptions, by apparently
indicating a date somewhere about 1535, goes only to
corroborate the information given by the History of the
Carnataca Governors. Therefore Nelson’s date has to be
rejected. It is not clear how he arrived at his conclusion.

13 Page 98, 1* Page 101. 15 C, &., WI, pp. 377-8.

page 77: 62 History of the Néyaks of Madura

His mistake is apparently duc to his dating the foundation
of the Nayakship in 1559, liven then, it is not possible to
explain his rejection of all this evidence.

Visvandtha’s Officers.—Vigvanitha was ably served in
ali his manifold and arduous undertakings by trustworthy
officers. He retained in his service some of his father’s
devoted servants. Pre-eminent among these was Ariyanatha
Mudaliyér. Born of poor parents in the neighbourhood of
Conjeevaram, he rose to the very high and responsible
position of Dalavay and Pradhani of Vigvanatha by sheer
merit. He co-operated with his master so conspicuously
in all his labours that he is spoken of as his ‘second in
power’ by Taylor.” A copper plate inscription of 1560
records a grant of twelve villages in the Tinnevelly country
by Vigvanatha and Ariyanatha.” Romanccattributes to him
feats of personal prowess and solutions of difficult and
abstruse problems, which attracted the notice of the Raya
and procured for him startling elevation from post to
post untilat last he became the dictator of the Vijaya-
nagar Empire.® His whole life is enveloped in tradition,
which makes extravagant and bewildcring claims to
greatness on his behalf. His equestrian statue in Pudu-
mandapam and the thousand-pillared hall are substantial
relics of his importance.

Another prominent officer of Visvanatha was Rama-
bhadra Nayaka, who did much to establish peace and order
in the country and who was deeply attached to him. He
is frequently referred to in the chronicles. It is highly
probable that he is the Ramappa Niiyaka of the inscrip-
tions, which speak of him as the agent of Vitthala in 129
of 1905, dated 1535, and 428 of 1916, dated 1552.% The
latier inscription refers to a gift of his under the orders of the

king. No. 121 of 1908, dated 1538, records his gift for the
merit of Achyuta.” No. 65 of 1916, dated 1542, is a gift
for his merit." In No. 119 of 1907, dated 1550, is another
record of Ramappa’s name.”

Visvanatha’s son, Krishnappa Nayaka, figures in the
inscriptions of his father’s time in 1546, 1550, 1553, and
1555." The Krishnapuram Plates of Sadagiva refer to his
part in the campaign against the Tiruvadi country. He
must have been of great service to Vigvanatha in his
military undertakings.

Visvandtha’s Character and Work.—That Vigvanatha
was a warrior of high degree is eloquently testified by
inscriptions. The chronicles make him a hero of chivalrous
qualities playing his part under providential arrangement.
In an inscription he is described as ‘the best skilled in
putting down disputes’.4 That he must have possessed
extraordinary tact and patience is evident from his suc-
cessful organization of the country amidst tremendous
clashing of interests and temper. In all his success, his
personality must have been an important contributory
factor.

Mr. Rangachari is never tired of singing the praise of
the ‘remarkable career of this remarkable man’.” He
goes even so far as to suggest that ‘the historian will join
the chroniclers, and praise, without hesitation and without
limitation, his work as a ruler and administrator ’, and that
‘he furnishes the subject of a free panegyric’.* Such
hero-worship cannot stand close scrutiny. No doubt

Visévanatha was a practical administrator of great talents.
' ‘The credit of restoring order in the country and organizing
it on a quasi-peace footing certainly belongs to him. The
institution of the Palaiyam System of administration was

the most practical solution of the difficultics. But he had
not the far-sceing stalesmanship to provide for its inevi-
table dangers. This piece of constructive work is attributed
by the chronicles more to Ariyandtha than to Vidvandtha.
The latter left the Marava country in an unsatisfactory
condition, a danger to the peace of the kingdom. He
was trained in the Vijayanagar imperial system, and he
made his mark in applying its principles in 4 systematic
manner. There is much originality in his work, but it is
difficult to say that he was not indebted to others.
Vigvanatha was great in perceiving the crying needs of the
times and providing for them effectively.

Another consideration that must modify our estimate
of Vigvanatha's work is that, though ruler of Madura, he
was not supreme in his dominions. He was eclipsed by
greater men whose willing subordinate he was content to
remain. Inthe southern campaign of Rima Raja Vitthala,
he does not appear to have figured prominently; and during
the former's presence in the country, he scems to have
played a very subordinate part. The country was too
disturbed to allow Vigvanidtha uncontrolled authority. On
the whole, he seems to have faithfully executed the imperial
plans for the administration of the kingdom, The
Vijayanagar Empire was then strong enough to assert its
control over the provinces,

The subordinate position of Viévanatha is clear from
insctiptions. He is referred to as the agent of Vitthala in
385, 599, and 721 of 1916, and as the agent of Achyuta in
113 of 1908.7” He recognizes the sovereignty of Achyuta
and Sadagiva in 113 of 1908, 622 of 1915, 599 of 1916, and
in the Anniyir inscription of 1560.% ‘There are some
inscriptions which make the position of Vitthala supreme
in the affairs of the South. ’ The existence of a few coins

of Visvanatha® does not go against his subordination to
the Vijayanagar Empire. It appears to have been cus-
tomary for the provincial rulers of the empire to have
an independent coinage of their own (limited probably to
smaller denominations), as is cvident from the following
observation of Cesar Frederick :—‘ When we came into
a new Governor’s country, although tributary to the King,
every onc of them stamped a several coin of copper, so that
the money we took this day would not serve the next.’
While thus Visvanatha was a loyal representative of
Vijayanagar in the south, he exercised much power in the
internal administration of the country. His work bears
the mark of individuality. Remission of taxes by him is
referred to in inscriptions. The Pandyas of Tenkasi were
his loyal feudatorics, and their power gradually increased
under his fostering care. Their inscriptions during Visva-
nitha’s administration are numerous. Visvanatha and
Ativirarima are mentioned in an inscription of 1558,”
and the latter was crowned Pandyan king in 1564. The
former’s coins show Pandya emblems like the fish. No. 16
of Hultzsch’s collection, above referred to, has on the
obverse the legend ‘ Pandiyan ’ and on the reverse ‘ Visva-
nadan’. Visvanatha’s son, Krishnappa Nayaka, must have
continued the same policy of close co-operation with the
Pandyas. Hence perhaps his title ‘ Pandyakulasthapana-
charya’ in the Krishnapuram Plates of Sadasiva. Visva-
natha had agents under him, like Uddandar,” and there are
inscriptions which record grants for his merit.
Visvandtha’s age and death.—The date of the death of
Vigvanatha is not recorded in any of the chronicles. The
only definite information which throws light on this

question is the statement in the Mrtyunjaya Manuscripts
that he had his son, Krishnappa Nayaka, crowned on 11th
Tai, Rudhirddgari (about the 25th of January, 1564).
Though Mr. Rangachari thinks that this is a ‘ more accu-
rate date’ than that given by the other chronicles, he says
that Krishnappa Niyaka ascended the throne in 1562 and
Visvanitha died in 1563. Probably he gocs wrong in the
equation of the cyclic year and date, Nelson puts Vigva-
natha’s death in December, 1563 ; he docs not seem to take
into account the crowning of his son before his death,
which is recorded in the Mrtyunjaya Manuscripts™ and
the History of the Carnataca Governors." It is very likely
that Vigvanitha desired some rest after his arduous
labours. Therefore Krishnappa Nayaka’s accession may
be placed in the beginning of 1564 and his father’s death
some time after. The former’s Krishnapuram inscription,”
which is taken to have been issued in 1563, is for the merit
of his father, who may have died hefore it: but the date
of this inscription has to be revised. The Saka date given
in it is supposed to be correct and equated to the
English datc, and the cyclic year Krodhana is brushed
aside as wrong, by the Madras Department of Epigraphy.
When these two dates do not agree, it seems reasonable
to take the Saka date to be wrong in general; for the
cyclic year was more frequently used, not only in official
documents but also in the every-day transactions of
life, by the Hindus. There is therefore greater likeli-
hood of the creeping in of a wrong Saka date than of
a wrong cyclic year, unless there are special reasons to
discredit the latter. Accordingly the date of the above-
mentioned inscription must be 1565, and the death of
Visvanitha may well have happened in 1564.

With regard to the probable age of Visvanitha at the
time of his death, Mr. Rangachari makes the following
observations: ‘He was born in the beginning of the
{6th century or a decade before. He could not have
been more than 60 at the time of his death in 1563.’™
‘ He gave up his life in the midst of his labours at evidently
a comparatively early age of about 55 or 60.7%" In
1559 Visvandtha is said to have been ‘in the prime of
manhood’.*8 From these references Mr. Rangachart’s
position seems to be very vague, confused, and even contra-
dictory. As we have remarked before, Visvanatha was
probably born about 1495, and consequently he may have
died when he was nearing seventy.

page 83: CHAPTER II
KRISHNAPPA NAYAKA I

(1564-1572)

KuMARA KrIsHNAP?VA, the son of Visvanatha, was crowned,
according to the Mrtyunjaya Manuscripis, on the 11th
of Tai, Rudhirddgari, corresponding approximately to the
45th of January, 1564. Though Mr. Rangachari dates his
accession in 1562, he remarks that the first event of his
reign was the battle of Talikota and the sack of Vijaya-
nagar in 1565. It is more probable that the discontent
of some Pologars culminated in a formidable rebellion soon
after his accession and the death of his father. It is not
unlikely that the sending of a part of the army for the
empire's defence precipitated this crisis, as Nelson con-
tends. But the Muhammadan attack on Vijayanagar came
rather suddenly, and it is probable that help from Madura
arrived only a little late, ic. in the beginning of 1565.
Even the presence of Ariyanatha in Madura, it appears,
would not have made much difference in the attitude of
Tumbichchi Nayaka, the leader of ,the rebellion, The
accession of a ruler would have afforded the, necessary
stimulus. The Palaiyam settlement of Visvanatha could
not possibly have satisfied ‘all: parties, and he may have
specially favoured some of his{northern followers in pre-
ference to others among them. Moreover, the antecedents
of Tumbichchi Nayaka were sure!to make him supremely
disgusted with his humble réle under the new dispensation.
From the chronicles it is clear that he was a man of some

influence and power in Madura. An inscription at
Kilakkarai’ mentions him along with Achyuta Raya. In
another record of Sobhakrit (1543), a certain Rama Raya
Tummigi bears such titles as ‘ head of the Sillavars’, ‘ King
of Vanga’, etc.? A Jesuit letter of 1608° describes a
‘Toumishirfyen’ (perhaps his descendant) as the chief
of all the Tottiyars. Such an influential and turbulent
chieftain could not but regret his modest status as onc
among numerous Polegars. He easily collected a large
number of his followers and discontented chiefs, entrenched
himself at Paramakudi, after strengthening its fortitications,
devastated the country round, and deficd the authority
of Krishnappa Nayaka. The latter is said to have acted
with great alacrity and reseurcefulness, and entrusted
the conduct of operations to Pedda Késavappa Nayaka
(his father’s officer), who is described as the Dalavay.
Tumbichchi Nayaka seems to have obstinately resisted his
forces, and he is said to have killed him. Probably foiled
in the first attempt, Krishnappa Nayaka sent his late
general’s son, Chinna Kégava, along with about thirteen
Polegars, a large number of troops, and a few picces of
ordnance, to storm the fort. This second attempt seems
to have been successful; Tumbichchi was captured and
beheaded. It is said that Krishnappa Nayaka treated
the rebel’s two sons with generosity, and entrusted them
with Paramakudi, Parambfir, and some neighbouring
villages which constituted a small Palaiyam. The re-
maining portion of Tumbichchi Nayaka’s territories was
confiscated, perhaps to teach a lesson to other refractory
Polegars. These proceedings clearly show that, though
Vigvanatha’s organization of the country gave rise to some
dissatisfaction, it had, on the whole, ensured the loyalty
and co-operation of most of the Polegars to his successors.

Invasion of Ceylon —~The Singhulu dvipa Catha' gives
a long account of Krishnappa Nayaka’s conquest of Ceylon.
It has such a convincing appearance of truth about it that
it ws highly probable that an expedition was undertaken,
‘ brief summary of the chronicle may be given here.
Krishnappa Nayaka was spoken of slightingly by the king
of Kandi, a friend of Tumbichchi Nayaka, because of the
latter’s execution. Outraged at this, he called for the
services of fifty-two of his Polegars with their troops, and
embarked for Ceylon at Navapdsiina and landed at
Mannar. A conciliatory message requiring homage and
tribute was rejected by the king of Kandi, who sent 40,000
men under four manéiris (ministers) and eight désandthelu
(governors) to arrest the progress of the invaders. A
sanguinary engagement took place at Puttalam, in which
the Kandian army was defeated by Chinna Késava Nayaka
(the general who finally put down the rebellion ol
Tumbichchi Nayaka) with 20,000 troops and a few chiefs.
Two ministers, five chieftains, and others were taken
prisoners, and treated with much humanity and considera-
tion by Krishnappa Nayaka. The captives urged their
king in vain to yield. The latter collected 60,000 troops
and 10,000 Kaffirs (probably Portuguese), and marched at -
their head to the battle-field. A bloody struggle ensued in
which 8,000 Kaffirs and about as many Sinhalese lost
their lives. In spite of the best efforts of Krishnappa
Nayaka and his general, the king of Kandi was not
captured alive. His dead body was taken with due
honours to the capital The Madura ruler remained there
for threc days. The deceased king’s family was sent to
Aurangam, the old capital ot Ceylon, and treated in a
fitting manner. Aftur appointing his brother-in-law, Vijaya
Gopila Nayaka, his viceroy in Ceylon, and arranging

* ‘Taylor, C.A,, ili, pp. 183-6,

page 86: Krishuappa Ndyaka I 71

for the regular payment of tribute, Krishnappa Nayaka
returned to Madura.

This account represents the Madura Nayak in the best
light possible. It may have been written by one of the
adherents of the Nayaks. It gives very elaborate details,
and is very precise and sober, though some of its state-
ments cannot be accepted without qualification. The cause
af the invasion seems to have been the withholding of the
usual tribute. This subordinate position of Ceylon with
regard to Madura is intelligible in the light of the claims
of the Vijayanagar emperors, Krishnadtva, Achyuta, and
Sadagiva Rayas, to have conquered Ceylon. According
to the chronicle abstracted above, homage and tribute
were demanded cven before actual fighting began ; and in
the end arrangements were made for the proper remittance
of tribute. It is unlikely, under the circumstances of his
position, that Krishnappa Nayaka would have undertaken
this expedition to wipe out the insult said to have been
offered to him by the ruler of Kandi. There is some
partisanship in the careful omission of all details which
might go against the Madura ruler, who is throughout
presented as a faultless man. The appointment of a
viceroy appears doubtful, as there is no evidence to show
that there were close relations between Madura and Ceylon
after this expedition, which a viceroyalty would necessitate.
Perhaps an officer was appointed to receive and remit
tribute.

Epigraphical evidence for this invasion of Ceylon is
meagre. Perhaps Sad&siva’s boast in Raktakshi (1564-5)
of his having ‘looted’ Ceylon’ is subsequent to this; if so,
the whole expedition would have been completed in a short
time. There is a Taramangalam inscription of 1567°
which refers to a Vira Vasanta Raya, ‘who conquered

3 Appendix D, N
* 19 of 1900 ; WER, ; 1900, p. 31; Sewell, i, p. 200

page 87: 72 History of the Né&yaks of Madura

Ceylon’. There is no specific reference in Turnour and
Wijesimha's Mahitvamsa to a Madura invasion of Ceylon
about this time, but this period of Ceylon history seems to
have been one of trouble and confusion. However, it is very
probable from the other sources that Krishnappa Nayaka
led an expedition to Ceylon, and that it was not for con-
quest, but for the enforcement of the payment of tribute
which was due from her, and which she had not paid
properly.

Mr. Rangachari remarks that Nelson’s conclusion viz.
that the war was a fact, is ‘ worthy of acceptance’? His
statement that it never happened, according to Taylor,
is not sufficiently borne out. The latter only expresses
himself in very cautious terms which are probably justified
by the nature of the evidence he had to deal with: ‘The
narrative in this manuscript is too particular, as to names,
places, and circumstances, to be a mere invention... . I
have no doubt that confirmation of the general fact of such
an invasion and conquest of Ceylon is obtainable from
papers in the collection if the same really happened ’.”

Krishuappa Néyaka's Attitude towards Vijayanagar.—
Mr. Rangachari’s opinion on this question does not seem to
be quite decided ; in one place, he says that ‘ his loyalty is
clear *;” in another, that his relation to the emperor is

‘one of uncertainty ’,"” meaning probably the {ull details of
that relationship. To establish Krishnappa’s loyalty to the
empire in 1565, Mr. Rangachari relies on an inscription of
1561. The Krishnapuram Plates of Sadasiva, dated 1567,
prove this question beyond a shadow of doubt ; Krishnappa
Nayaka is referred to in them in many culogistic terms
with several high-sounding titles, and described as one
‘who knew the truth about duty’, etc.” There are other

references to Krishnappa Nayaka in the inscriptions of
Sadagiva, dated 1568 and 1571,” the latter of which is a gift
for the merit of the Nayak. \Vhatever may he the defects
of the Mrtyunjaya Manuscripts dealing with the life of
Ariyanatha, it may be true that he was sent to Vijayanagar
to do his best to ward off the Muhammadan peril. Nothing
definite is known about his services to the empire at this
critical time. Mr. Rangachari narrates in detail all the
wild, inconsistent, and-improbable tales about his move-
ments and behaviour in the north. The fact that he
returned to, and permanently settled in, Madura within
less than two years after the battle of Talikota (in Akshaya,
ie. 1566-7) clearly shows that he became very much
chastened by experience, and came back ‘ a sadder and a
wiser man’, if he had high ambitions. On the basis of
such authorities, probably, Mr. Rangachari makes bewtlder-
ing guesses in attempting to explain Ariyanatha’s return.™
After his return from the north in 1566-7, Ariyanatha
probably concerned himself much with works of a quasi-
public nature. He is said to have called his relatives from
Conjivaram, settled them in Sdlavandan and other villages,
built them houses and a temple, and supplied all the needs
of a place of habitation. He seems to have amused him-
self with building and improving temples and _ other
structures all over the kingdom of Madura. But much is
made of the statement in the Mripunjaya Manuscripts
that he was Dalavay and Pradhani during four successive
reigns till 1600. Mr. Rangachari speaks of Ariyanatha as
the chief friend and counsellor of Krishnappa Nayaka.
Following Nelson, he thinks that he was the guiding spirit
in the administration of the country till his death, and that
the Nayaks were merely his instruments. There is hardly
adequate evidence to support such a weighty conclusion.

10

page 89: 74 History of the Niyaks of Madura

Probably he was holding the two principal offices in name,
and in recognition of lis past services; there is an inscrip-
tion of 1570," which refers to him as the agent of Vigva-
natha Nayaka, Krishnappa Nayaka, and Virappa Nayaka,

The carly vears of the reign of Krishnappa Nayaka seem
to have been a very anxious period. He had to provide
for the peace of the country troubled by a few hot-headed
Polegars under the leadership of Tumbichchi Naiyaka; he
had to put the Ceylon ruler in the right attitude of a sub-
ordinate paying regular tribute; he had, further, to see that
the imperial cause was not endangered by his default.
While discharging these dutics, he seems to have been not
unmindful of the work of peaceful administration and
progress. He is said to have built Krishnapuram, a town
{o the cast of Palamcotta, and another called Kadaiyam-
Krishnipuram to the west of Tinnevelly. The former
seems to have reccived greater attention from him. The
Krishnapuram Plates of Sadasiva record the grant of a
number of villages to the Tiruvéngadanitha temple, built
there by Krishnappa Nayaka, ‘encircled by a wall...
and a broad and loity tower, with a large ranga-mandapa
raised on a collection of beautiful stone pillars and adorned
with rows of sprouts’. ‘He built a car... and also
broad roads round the temple... for God Vishnu set
up there" He is said to have built a Siva temple
also, constructed a Teppakulam and several agrahdras,
and looked after the other necds of the town. The
Krishnapuram inscription of Krddhana (1565)™" records
ihe grant of six villages and some land in Alikudi to the
same temple. Probably the town was huilt earlier, not
necessarily in Krishnappa Nayaka’s reign, and was improved
now. Inscriptions refer to his henefactions to other
temples.

Krishyappa Nayaka's Character and Work.—Krishnappa
Nayaka seems to have distinguished himself even during
the administration of his father. The earliest inscription
referring to him™ is one for his merit, dated 1546.
Sadisiva’s inscription of 1550’? mentions him. An inscrip-
tion of 1553 records his gift of land to a temple: in
another of 1555, Ekambara Mudaliyar, his agent, makes a
gift of land.” Records dated 1562 are those of his gifts to
temples.” The Krishndpuram Plates of Sadagiva, dated
1567, describe him as ‘the lord of Ndnchibura and
Aildvalipura, who, by his valour, deprived the insolent
King of the Tirnvadi-rajya of the seven (component) parts
(of his kingdom) ;” who was famous as the Pandyakula-
sthapanacharya, who was the revered lord of the Southern
Ocean’. These expressions clearly indicate his share in
the campaigns against the Travancore country and the
Pindyas in the reign of Achyuta Raya, and in the
campaigns at Ramaraja Vitthala later. He appears as
the equal of his father in martial qualities, and as a
notable imperial general. His other characteristics of
wisdom, mercy, uprightness, and generosity are emphasized
in this epigraphical record, which confirms, to a great
extent, the opinion of the chronicles. He seems to have
been a capable and wise ruler, bearing the welfare of his
subjects constantly in mind. His marked individuality
and reputation would have rendered any rise of Ariyanatha’s
influence beyond limits impossible. He gave the country
strong and beneficent rule, which was badly needed at the.
time. He vigorously checked the evil ways of some of the
Polegars, and by his firmness and moderation taught them
respect for constituted authority.

His Death.—After a somewhat short reign of nearly nine

years, he died on the 19th of Kartikai, Angirasa (about the
3rd of December, 1572). This is the date given by one of
the Mrtyunjaya Manuscripts that generally gives some
details about the dates which do not often scriously conflict
with inscriptions. Mr. Rangachari relies, it seems, on
the Pdndyan Chronicle, which gives Magi, Angirasa ;
but there is a Dharapuram inscription” of Virappa Nayaka,
his successor, which is dated 9th Margali, Angirasa.
Hence the date of the latter chronicle will have to be
rejected. Krishnappa Nayaka must have died about the
beginning of December, 1572.

VIRAPPA NAYAKA
(1572-1595)

VIRAPPA NAYAK. succeeded his father on the throne to-
wards the end of 1572. Mr. Rangachari, following Nelson,
speaks of a dual royal authority: ‘A remarkable feature in
the position of these rulers was the joint holding of the
royal dignity by brothers.’' Nelson’ says: ‘ The two sons
(of Krishnappa Nayaka) . . . were permitted by Arya
Nayaga to rule the country with co-ordinate authority.’
This view seems to be based on Taylor’s translation of the
Tamil manuscripts, where the expression ‘ second in power’
is used. But Taylor makes Ariyanatha ‘second in power’
to Visvanatha. The chronicles no doubt frequently speak
of a‘ Chinna Dorai’ associated in government ; at the same
time they almost invariably say that the one was crowned
and the other made ‘Chinna Dorai’. But Nelson and Mr.
Rangachari do not speak of joint rule throughout; they
confine their view to the period between 1573 and 1600.
The former admits that when Virappa Nayaka died in
1595, he was succeeded by his sons; but he presumes,
therefore, that his co-ruler must have died before.” In the
case of Virappa Nayaka, a co-ruler is not mentioned in
most of the chronicles. It appears that Nelson was guided
by the Péndyan Chronicle, which, however, speaks of
Vigvanatha dnd Virappa as rulers, not in the reverse way
taken by him and Mr. Rangachari. The Mrtyunjaya
Manuscripts do not refer to any joint rulers at all. Taylor

1 1.4.96, p. Bl. *n. 105.

page 93: 78 History of the Ndyuaks of Mudura

does not go to the extent that Nelson does, but expresses
himself with much restraint and caution; ‘It is to be pre-
sumed, from the first mention here occurring, that the
subsequent custom of committing a secondary authority to
a younger brother of the reigning prince, carrying with it a
right to the throne in case of the elder onc leaving no
legitimate posterity, was now first hegun.’ *

The evidence of inscriptions goes directly against this
theory of Nelson. The Kiniyir Plates of Venkata II, and
the Vellangudi Plates and the Dalavay Agraharam Plates
of Venkata I, which give a gencalogy of the early Nayaks,
are absolutely silent about joint rulers. From other in-
scriptions there is no ground for supposing that there was
joint rule among these Nayaks at any time. The proba-
bility in the circumstances is that seme member of the
royal family next to the ruler was assuciated in power ina
way similar to the time-honoured custom of the Cholas,
or to that of some of the present-day Rajas of India in
having a Yuvaraja or Elayaraja. ;

Though Mr. Rangachari speaks of ‘ Visvanatha II’ as the
colleague of Virappa Nayaka, he describes everywhere the
work of the latter. The only important event which tended
to disturb the peace of the country seems to have been the
rebellion of a Mavali Vanadaraya. The chronicles speak
of a Sundaratts) Mavali Vanadariyar and others as illegiti-
mate sons of a Pandya king, who were crowned in succes-
sion kings of Madura by Lakkanta Nayaka, and whose
period of rule was in the second half of the fifteenth
century.‘ Probably the rebel against Virappa Nayaka was

* Miivali Vaniidariiyan was the title of chiefs of the Baga country in

to the vicissitudes of history, It seems likely that some of them were
transferred to this region as a result of the war that Kulottunga III had
to carry on against the ruling Pindyas during the years 1261-72, When
the Pandyas gained the ascendancy, the chieftains appoluted to rule

one of their descendants. There are a number of inscrip-
tions of these Vanadarayars in the sixteenth century, which
are found in Tirupullani, Kalaiyarkovil, and Dévipattanam
in the Ramnad district.* Therefore it is very likely that
they had some pretensions and cherished high ambitions.
Vigvandtha, in all probability, conciliated them by giving
them a dignified place in his Palaiyam System. It is not
clear what occasioned their hostile activity under Virappa
Nayaka, and who it was that was actually responsible for
it. The chronicles say that the king of Mavalivanam
fortified Manamadurai and Kalaiyarkovil and took posses-
sion of the neighbouring territory. The action of Vilappa
Nayaka is described as having been prompt and decisive.
He brought the transaction toa close by the confiscation
of his Palaiyam. It is curious that Mr. Rangachari should
think that 366 of 1901 (an error for 366 of 1909) *, which
mentions a Vanadarayar as the agent of Virappa Navakar-
aiyan, ‘evidently refers to his defeat and later loyalty ’.’
This inscription is dated Parabhava (1606) and is found at
Tayantr (Tirukkoyiltir taluk, South Arcot district), while
the transactions recorded in the chronicle have reference
to the present-day district of Ramnad. The strong measure
iaken by Virappa Nayaka after his revolt seems to preclude
the probability of ‘later loyalty’.

Nelson and Mr. Rangachari take Virappa Nayaka for a
roi fainéant under the masterful thumb of Ariyanatha, who,
according to the latter, was ‘in reality the sovereign of the
country’. As has been remarked before, Ariyanatha may
have been Dalavay and Pradhani in name, but there is
these territories had apparently borne these titles, if they did not belong
to the family. Hence this region had been under a succession of chiefs
of this title who held on to their strongholds even during the temporary
‘occupation of Madura by a succession of Muhammadan Sultans from
1310-78. They are found mentioned in the early inscriptions of Vijaya-
nagar under Harihara I, and Lakkana’s recognition of their position
under Dévariiya Il follows as a matter of course.—Z@.

absolutely no real evidence of his dominating influence.
‘There is not even an incidental reference to him in inscrip-
tions throughout the long reign of Virappa Nayaka.
The latter figures largely in them, and in a record of
159+ * he is said to have ‘ levied tribute from every country’.
The chronicles, in treating of his reign, say nothing
about Ariyanatha’s position and power. Virappa Nayaka
seems to have had perfect control over his feudatories, the
Pandyas of Tenkasi and the Tiruvadi.* The inscriptions
of Vijayanagar emperors invariably refer to him as the
ruler. Other numerous inscriptions of his make it clear
that he had a strong hold over all his wide dominions, and
was the real master of the country.

His Attitude towards the Vijayanagar Hinperors.—
Inscriptions show that Virappa Nayaka continued the policy
of subordination and loyalty towards the Vijayanagar
emperors, which his father and grandfather had followed.
Epigraphical records of the Vijayanagar emperors are found
in the Nayak dominions. The Dalavay Agraharam Plates of
Venkata I, dated 1586, record a gift in accordance with the
wishes of Virappa Nayaka." Other records of this emperor
indicate that he exercised greater control over the south
than his two immediate predecessors; these are an inscrip-
tion at Piranmalai, dated 1588," another at Erode in the
same year,” anda grant of some villages in the Tinnevelly
district to a Vishnu temple under the management of a
certain Krishnadaés of date 1590.% In the Sérmadévi in-
scription of Sriranga, dated 1594,)! Virappa is mentioned
as a feudatory. Virappa’s Krishnapuram inscription of
1577" mentions Sriranga; in the Sérmadévi inscription
of 1578" he calls himself Sriranga’s agent. Though
there were three successive emperors ruling at Penukonda

during this period, only Venkata’s control appears to have
been predominant. There is no doubt about Virappa’s
loyalty to all of them, including Tirumala and Sriranga, but
their influence on Madura affairs seems to have depended
on their power. A gradual tightening of the imperial
control is, how ever, perceptible towards the end of the reign
of Venkata I."

Virappa Nayaka’s comparatively long reign scems ta
have been a period of peace and prosperity. The chronicles
speak of his improvements in the Trichinopoly fort, the
construction of a fort at Aruppukkéttai (Ramnad), the
building of the walls of defence round the Chidambaram
temple, and the grant of many agrahdras in charity.
There is no mention in them of any bencfactions of his
to the temple of Sundarégvara and Minakshi in Madura.
The Tiruppanimdlai verses (52-4) enumerate, however.
his construction of the Velliyambalam, the northein
gopuram, the Servigévaram, the kitchen, the thousand-
pillared mandapa (pavilion with a thousand pillars), the
Mirtiyamman mandapa, the Surru mandapa pavilion
round the temple) in the second prdkdra (enclosing wall
and circumambulating space), and the Virappa mandapa
with sculptured pillars. He is said to have covered the
pillars of the mandapa of the Minakshi temple with gold.
The Dalavay Agrahiram Plates of Venkata 1 (1586) seem

17 When, after the battle of Talikota, the capital changed to Penu-
konda, the authority of the headquarters over Madura apparently
continued intact. The empire was, however, composed of three separate
charges, over each of which was placed a prince under the sovereign
authority of the ruler for the time-being. This, arrangement first
came into use on the death of Tirumala I, when Sriranga succeeded
to the empire with headquarters at Penukonda; his brother, Rima,
became viceroy or ‘ vice-regent’ at Srirangapattanam, .and the last
brother, Venkata, became similarly viceroy of Madura. Stiranga died
without issue; Rama predeceased him ; and Venkata became emperor
in his turn. It was at this time that there was a rebellion, or an
attempt at one, in Madura, Venkata sent his nephew, Tirumala, son of
Rama, to put down the rebellion. Instead of doing so, he made
common eatise with the enemy and went over to Srirangapattanam.
Venkata had subsequently to carry on the war against Madura and
bring it back to its allegiance, while Srirangapattanam remained
practically independent,—Zq,

1}

page 97: 82 History of the Na@yaks of Madura

to confirm this to some extent ; they say that ‘ Virabhipati
constructed a mandapa of rare sculptures in front of thé
shrine of Sundara Nayaka and presented the Goddess
Minaksh¥ with a gold kavacha (mail-coat studded with
gems) ’2* An inscription in the temple of Sundarésvara,”
dated 1584, refers to the construction of the Kambatiadi
mandapa ‘ with a number of sculptured pillars representing
Puranic scenes’. Thus Virappa Nayaka devoted much of
his wealth to religious works.

He appears to have been an impartial ruler very much
concerned with the proper administration of justice. The
Goripalaiyam inscription of Bhava, ic. 1574, refers to a
dispute with regard to a large piece of land, said to have
been granted to the Muhammadans hy a Kin Pandya.
Virappa Nayaka conducted an elaborate inquiry, according
to the inscription, and confirmed the old grant. This also
indicates his attitude towards the Pandyas: he appears to
have been well disposed towards them. If the Pudukottai
Plates of Sri Vallabha were issued in 1583, his relation
towards the Pandyas as over-lord is clear.

Introduction of Christianity —About 1592, towards the
close of Virappa Nayaka’s reign, the Jesuit missionaries,
working among the Paravas, established a mission in
Madura under Father G. Fernandez, to convert the people
of the country, especially the higher classes. They got
permission from the Nayak to build a church and presbytery.
The whole-hearted and unostentatious work of Fernandez
bore no fruit; he worked in vain for about fourteen years,
without being able to convert anybody. The principal
cause of his failure was the great contempt which the
people felt for the Portuguese” (or the Parangis, as they

appeared in the battle of Toppitiz, which gives an idea of contemporary

were called) owing to their cating becf, drinking intoxicating
liquors, and associating themselves with the Paraiyas.
Albert Laerzio, in his letter of November 20, 1609,
‘says: ‘Nothing can remove this disagreeable impression,
neither the noble courage of the Portuguese, the magnitude
of their power, the glitter of their wealth, nor the glory of
their victories and conquests. Further, Fernandez had
nol a proper appreciation of the real difficulties and had
neither brain nor courage to find out the best mode of
approach under the circumstances. Thus the first attempt
to convert the high-class Hindus of Madura to Christianity
was a complete failure.

Virappa’s death.—After a reign of about twenty-two
years and nine months Virappa Nayaka died, according to
a Mrtyunjaya Manuscript, in Avani, Manmatha (the begin-
ning of September, 1595). His last inscription is dated
Jaya;® the earliest inscription of his successor 1s in
Manmatha ;* hence Virappa must have died at least before
April, 1596. So the date given by the above-mentioned
chronicle may be taken to be correct.

page 99: CHAPTER V
KRISHNAPPA NAYAKA H
(1595-1001)

Virnapra NAYAKA had three sons; Kuinara Krishnappua,
Visvappa, and Kastiri Rangappa. He was succeeded by
the eldest, known also as Vira Krishna, in September,
1595, Nelson speaks of the joint rule of Krishnappa
and Visvappa. Mr. Rangachari thinks that the latter way
the elder brother. Both agree in saying that the joint
rulers were in the leading-strmgs of old Ariyanatha.
They regard the death of the latter as the most important
event of this period. While Nelson! welcomes it as the
deliverance of the Nayaks from his benumbing influence
and as the removal of the chief stumbling-block to all
progress, Mr. Rangachari deplores it as ‘not only a loss
but (a) disaster’: for ‘ Ariyandtha . .. gave the Naik
kingdom its strength and ils security, its organization and
its resources.”? ‘ Besides guiding the kings of Madura, he
took upon himself the task of maintaining the integrity of
the Empire and saving the descendants of Krishnadéva
Raya from the shadow of neglect and danger of extinction."
‘He, in short, . . . kept the union of the tottering empire
by his loyalty.’4 Taylor’s warning * that ‘any conjectures
founded on these indications may for the present be spared’
has been neglected with a vengeance ; there is not an iota
of evidence to substantiate this extravagant panegyric.

page 100: Krishuappa Ndyaka 1° 85

The date of the death of Ariyanatha is 1600, according
to Nelson. Mr. Rangachari’s estimate of the duration of
his power and his date for his death do nol seem to be
quite consistent. At first he says: ‘For more than half
ua century after Visvanatha’s death’ (which occurred
in 1563, according to him) .. . ‘he (Ariyanatha) was the
pilot of the infant kingdom.’® This statement puts the
death of Ariyanatha after 1613. Later on: ‘But Arya-
natha’s labours were not destined to end as Visvanatha's
lieutenant and minister. He was destined to hold that
power for the next 40 years’.” Accordingly Ariyanatha
must have died in 1603. Finally: ‘For more than
38 years he had been the life of the young state, and
given it glory and success.’ ‘In 1600 he felt the effects of
age and toil, and succumbed to death.’* It is very hard to
understand the process by which Mr. Rangachari managed
to come to this final conclusion, on the basis.of the
irreconcilable statements quoted above.

With regard to the age of Ariyanatha at the time
of his death, Mr. Rangachari similarly changes his
position. In the beginning, he says that he was born
‘somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd decade of the 16th
century’ and that he ‘must have been about 2U years
younger than Vigvanatha’.® Further on, he remarks that,
in 1595, he was ‘more than 80°. If Mr. Rangachari
is not sure whether Ariyanatha was born in the second or
the third decade of the sixteenth century, he could hardly
be more than eighty in 1595 as he asserts. If he stands by
the latter statement, Ariyanatha’s birth could not have been
later than at least 1515, and the alternative of the. third
decade has to-go.’ According to Mr. Rangachari, Vigvanatha
was “born in the beginning of the 16th century of a
decade before’." Taking only 1500 for Vigvanatha’s birth,

page 101: 86 History of the Ndyaks of Madura

Ariyanatha’s birth would be in 1520, and in 1595 he
would be only seventy-five, and not ‘more than 80’.
Mr. Rangachari does uot state his authority for all these
conjectures, and only his assertion stands that Arivandtha
was more than eighty in 1595. Ifso, he must have been
at least cighty-five at the time ascribed for his
death.

We shall take Mr. Rangachari's final date for Ariyanatha’s
death as 1600 and examine its probability. It is uppa-
rently based on Taylor’s translation of a Mrtyunjeya
Manuscript” which says that Ariyanitha died on the
7th Chittirai, Sarvari, and ‘held the united offices of
minister and generalissimo during four reigns, or thirty-
eight years and nine months*. The original of this transla-
tion gives the date as 7th Chittirai, Sarvadhdri, which
is 19th April, 1588, approximately. There are only two
inscriptions which refer to Ariyandtha ; one of 1560" and
another of 1570, where he, along with two others, is des-
cribed as the agent of Visvanitha Nayaka, Krishnappa
Nayaka, and Virappa Nayaka.” But there is not sufficient
evidence to arrive at a definite conclusion regarding his age
and date of death. Therefore, the date 1600 for the event
can be accepted only provisionally, if at all, There seems to
be no valid ground for supposing that he was twenty years
younger than Visvanatha ; on the contrary, it is likely that
he was a little older. The Myrtyunjaya Manuscript on
his life says that he took Visvandtha with him to the south.
Considering the difficulties of his task, it is probable
that the latte: was given an elderly adviser. If so,
Ariyanatha must have lived to a ripe old age.

Krishpappa Nayaka appears prominently in the inscrip-
tions of the period. Heis described as ‘sitting on the
lion-throne of Vallabha Naréndra’ in a record of 1596,"

2 0, H. MSS., ii, p. 119 9 Tbid.. p. 120,

page 102: Krishuappa Ndyaka I 87

and as the ‘Pandya Parthiva Krishna Nyrpatih’ (King
Krishna, the Pandya king) in 1597.27 It was he who was
responsible for the Vellangudi Plates of Venkata 1, dated
1598, and the Padmanéri copper plates of the same year.
In an inscription of 1600" his agent is mentioned. Thus his
epigraphical records range between 1596 and 1600, and he
is all in all throughout his reign. Mr. Rangachari admits
that nothing is known about his elder brother and co-ruler,
* Vigvanatha TIT’.

The Vijayanagar emperor, Venkata I, is recognized as
the paramount sovereign by Krishnappa Nayaka ™ and by
the Pandyas.” A few records of the former make his
position clear; these are his copper plate grant of 1597 at the
request of Krishnappa Nayaka” and his Vellangudi Plates
of 1598. Venkata I had thus sufficient control over both
the Nayaks and their subordinates, the Pandyas; and the
latter were Joyal to him. The inscriptions of the Pindyas
show that their power was gradually increasing under the
Niyaks. Further, the grant of villages in the Tiruvadi-
rajya® indicates that the conquered territory of Travancore
remained intact, and the Tiruvadi was at least not aggres-
sive. Krishnappa Nayaka’s position with regard to the
Paindyas and Travancore was secure and his loyalty to the
empcror beyond question.

His death,—After a short reign of about five years and
nine months, Krishnappa Nayaka died in Vaikagi, Plava
(May-June, 1601), according to the Mrtyunjaya Manuscripts.
The Pandyan Chronicle gives the period of his reign as seven
years, from Margali, Manmatha, to Chittirai, Plava ; but this
comes to only about five years and four months. There is
consistency between the dates and the total period in the

between the two with regard to the final date of the reign.
Further, there is no conflict with inscriptions, the last one
for Krishnappa belonging to (600,

MUTTU KRISHNAPPA NAYAKA

(1601-1609)

ON the death of Krishnappa Nayaka II, the throne is
said to have been usurped by his voungest brother, Kastiri
Ranga, the other brother Visvappa having predeceased
him. Within the course of about a week the usurper is
said to have been murdered in the Sandyamandapa, pro-
bably as an expression of popular protest against his action,
and’ Muttu Krishnappa crowned. This latter is not men-
tioned by the Péndyan Chronicle and by one Mrtyunjaya
Manuscript;' but it is clear from the other chronicles,
inscriptions, and a few coins, that he came to the throne
some time after the death of Krishnappa Nayaka IJ.
Nelson and Mr. Rangachari, following some chronicles,
consider Muttu Krishnappa as the son of Krishnappa
Nayaka II. But a Mrtyunjaya Manuscript? and the
Maduraittalavaraléru say that he was the son of Visvappa,
the younger brother of Krishnappa Nayaka I]. This view
is confirmed by the Kiniyir Plates of Venkata II, which
give the genealogy of the Nayaks up to Tirumala Nayaka.
Hence it is to be taken that Muttu Krishnappa was the son
of Vigvappa, the second son of Virappa Nayaka. ;
Organization of the Marava Country.—The most im-
portant event of Muttu Krishnappa’s reign was the effective
organization of the Marava country under the Sétupatis.
Whether the Sétupatis were established or restored is

immaterial to our present purpose, but it is highly probable
that they were the vassals of the Pindyas before. Nelson
says: ‘It seems probable that in the time of Muttu
Krishnappa, the Ramnad country . . . was under the
management of two Commissioners appointed by the
Governor of Madura.” Mr. Rangachari thinks that this
experiment may have been made by Visvanitha, the
founder of the Nayak dynasty, and asserts that it was a
success till 1600. It was only after this year that the
Ramnad country fell into anarchy, He attempts to shield
Vigvanitha and Ariyanatha, his heroes, from any charge of
neglect of the Marava country.' But Nelson speaks of the
unqualified failure of the commission. Perhaps Muttu
Krishnappa hinself, or one of his immediate predecessors,
tried that plan. In any case, the final organization of
the country was the work of Muttu Krishnappa,

5 Tho position of the Nivaks in regard to foreigners trading along
the coast country was probably a mere continuation of the poliey
pursued by the Pindyas, There are good reasons for believing that
with the great Cholas the overseas enterprise of the Tamils came to an
end and gradually gave place to Aral enterprise whieh ulthnately
superseded all Tamil effort in this direction both on the coast and in
the Archipelago. Under the last great Pindya, Kulag&khara, the agent
of the horse-trading Jamal-ud-Din, Governor of Shiraz, held the
chief place in this region. He occupied, aceording to the Muhammadan
historians, a high place even in the councils of the Pandya, This
position of the agent of the Muhammadan trader at Kayal is in striking
contrast to the position that the foreigners occupied under the great
Cholas, as is exemplified in the case of the mere building of a Buddhist
Vib@ra and making grants of lands to it by the rulerg of Kadairam
under the great Cholas ‘The rulers of Kadiiram (Sri Bhéja ar
Palambang) had to obtain permission in both casos by sending out
special missions and obtaining the requisite license through the inter-
vention of the foreign secretary of the Cholas. That state of things
had completely vanished tnder the Pindyas. The conquest of the
Pandya country by Vijayanagar does not appear to have provided for
this immediately, as in all probability this conquest did not involve the
acquisition of all the const territory by the new empire. 1 is du

unaltered, Gradually, however, the establishment of an
independent authority, at the back of their dominions, was
felt by the Nayaks to be prejudicial to their interests.

government comes into view. Laukkana had the combined title of
Viceroy of Madura and ' Lord of the Southern Ocean’. This‘ Lordship
of the Southern Ocean ' seems to imply control over the ports and, to a
certain extent, command of the overseas trade. In the period of
usurpation an effort was made to bring the Pandyas under control.
chiefly thiough the efforts of Narasa Nayaka, the father of the great
king Krishnadéya Riya. That probably meant a more thorough
conquest of the whole region and its reduction to a position of sub-
ordination to the empiie as a means of extending the imperial
authouty down to the coast, as it was about that time when the
Portuguese made their first appearance on the west coast. The
enterprise of foreigners un the coast assumed a more definite shape and
showed aggiessive features under Vaseo da Gama and Albuquerque.
‘The dissatistaction expressed by the latter in regard to the reception
given to his agent, Ira. Luiz, immediately after the fall of Goa 1s
evidence of the cautious imperial policy of Krishnadéva Riya. His
subsequent transactions with the Portugtiese showed a spirit friendly
to their commercial enterprise; but he was equally clear in dis-
countenancing the more agyressive enterprise of the Portuguese against
the coast powers, as In the case of the Zamorin of Calicut, against whom
Albtquerque sought an alliance with the Raya. Krishna gave no reply
to this, indicating clearly that he did not favour that kind of enterprise
The coming of Francis Xavier to the Parava coast, combined with
various others of the doings of the Portuguese on the west coast,
indicated the character of the peaceful penetiation of the Portugtese
missionaries actively supported by the Portuguese civil government.
It was the advent of this new influence that called for more drastic
action on the part of the empire, the so-called invasion of the Badages
against which Pottuguese writers bitterly complain. It was no more
than a drastic effort made to assert imperial authority, and explains the
constant vigilance and active enterprise of Rimaraja Vitthala and his
brother Timma in the south for a period almost of ten years. The
adoption of Christianity by the Paravas was held toimply a change of
fealty from the Indian government to the king of Portugal, and that
naturally would have provoked drastic measures for the assertion of
Vijayanagar authority. Visvanitha’s subordinate position diming this
period of Ramaraja Vitthala’s activity in the south finds an explanation
in this, as also the immediately preceding effort to extend Travancore
authority across the whole peninsula to the east coast. This re-
assertion of imperial authority seems to have been in the main
successful and held good so long as the empire lasted. After the battle
of Talikota, the peaceful efforts of the missionaries, chiefly Jesuits,
combined with the enlightened policy of toleration pursued by the
emperors, gradually enabled them to gain lost ground and even renew
their aggressive activity which involved the change of political
allegiance, It is this undercurrent of political activity of the mission-
aries that brought the native powers down upon them in India, as in
the famous persecutions of the Christians in the Roman empire during
the early centuries of the Christian era.—Ad.

The following remarks of Bishop Caldwell ® explain the
situation created by the policy of indifference lowards the
coust region which the Nayaks followed in the beginning :
‘Xavier... speaks of the Paravas as “subjects of His
Portuguese Majesty”... The entire civil and criminal
jurisdiction of the fishery coast had been seized upon by the
Portuguese, and... all dues and taxes, including the
valuable revenue arising from the pvarl-fishery, had been
assumed by the governors appointed by the Portuguese
Viceroy. The Portuguese had not asked: any native
potentate’s consent to the formation of their settlements.’
Thus political disruption and financial spoliation seem to
have followed in the wake of commercial and religious
penetration. It was probably to counteract these hostile
influences of foreigners that Muttu Krishnappa established
a strong government in the Marava country.

These political and financial motives seem to lave been
the chief cause of the revival of the Sétupatis, A religious
purpose was not wanting. The whole Marava country was
in a chaos of disorder and insecurity, and consequently the
way to Ramégvaram, to which pilgrims flocked, was rendered
unsafe. The date of this event is said in a dMuckensie
Manuscript’ to be 1605. This is likely to be correct, as
the first Sétupati inscription of this period belongs to 1607.

The actual circumstances leading to the restoration of
the Sétupatis are described by the chronicles in their own
way. As is usual with Mr. Rangachari, he does not neglect
to cram into his history all the romantic literature on the
subject; he is very careful not to omit even stories of
‘doubtful veracity’ and ‘absurd and inaccurate’ versions of
events, in his own terminology, Readers, eager for the
strange and the curious, may find much mental pabulum in
his elaborate narratives and lengthy extracts. What is clear

* Taylor, O. #7 ALSS., ti, Appendix, p. dl,

page 108: Mutiu Krishuabpa Nayaka 93

from the account of the chronicles is that Muttu Krishnappa
made Sadaika Tava, Udaiyan Sctupati, only after testing
his capacity to deal effectively with the situation in the
Marava country. It seems that the latter was allowed
a free hand on agreeing to pay a fixed tribute. At
lirst he appears to have made the passage to RamGsvaram
safe by fortifying Ramnad and Pogalir, and arranging
escorts for the pilgrims. The turbulent chiefs in the
surrounding country were subdued and a strong govern-
ment established at Kalaiyarkévil, Pattamangalam, and
other places, most probably by Sadaika Téva or Dalavay
Sctupati, though all this is attributed to his son, Kittan
Sétupati. by the History of the Carnataca Governors.

Dalaviy Sétupati’s inscriptions at Raméévaram record
his gifts to the temple ; these are a grant of five villages in
1607, and another grant of eight villages in 1608. A
copper plate record of 1608 refers tu a grant of lands to the
temple servants.” He seems to have been a successful ruler
who did much for peace and progress by clearing forests
and encouraging cultivation. It is likely that he ruled till
1623, as the Mackenzie Manuscript, referred to above, says,
and was succeeded by his son, Kiittan Sétupati; for the
latter’s first inscription ® is dated 2ist Masi, Rudhirodgari
(the beginning of March, 1624).

Christianity and Robert de NobilimWe have seen how
the Madura Mission was established towards the close of
the reign of Virappa Nayaka, and how the first attempts at
conversion failed to cope with the insuperable obstacles to
success. Still Fernandez continued his futile policy with
much perseverance till 1606, when new developinents in
missionary activity overwhelmed his work. In the reign
of Muttu Krishnappa a most thorough-going scheme of
conversion to Christianity, which owed its inception and
execution to Robert de Nobili, was worked out. This great

experiment of de Nobili and the work of his successors in
the Madura Mission are important chapters in the history
of Christianity in India, Though they have been clabo-
rately dealt with by scholars best fitted to handle them,
they are yet subjects of controversy, because much
partisanship inevitably enters into questions of religion and
religious history. The works of J. Hough (History of
Christianity in India) and J. W. Kaye (Christianity in
India) are charged with much passion and vehemence,
exhibiting an utter want of ‘sympathy’ with the subject ;
and, therefore, they are of doubtful value. The Rev. J. 5.
Chandler (The Jesuit Mission in Madura) handles the
subject more soberly, We are at present directly concerned
only with the political influences and results of missionary
activities.

De Nobili seems to have formed a general plan of his
work in India, even before leaving Hurope. [Me is said to
have declared like St. Paul: ‘T will make myself Indian
to save the Indians." Hercin lay the germs of his policy
of Indianizing Christianity. By birth an Italian, connected
with the ecclesiastical hicrarchy of Europe, he was endowerl
with a towering personality and a penetrating intellect.
He came to Madura in December, 1606, and his uninter-
rupted * meditation’ was perhaps on the details of his plan
uf campaign. He had already analvséd the causes of his
predecessor's failure, and he scrupulously avoided the im-
pression of a Parcigi by a careful regulation of his dress
and diet. He openly dissociated himself from Fernandez,
proclaiming that he (de Nobili) was a * Roman Brahman‘,
His daring and original plan consisted mainly of three
features, viz. ‘the adaptation of the life of the missionary
to that of the people’ (the Brahmans’, ‘ the appropriation
of harmless (Hindu) customs and ceremonies for Christian
use’, and ‘the thorough study of the vernaculars (and

‘© Bertrand, ti, p. 4,

page 110: Muttu Krishnappa Naéyaka 95

Sanskrit, the language of the sacred books of Hinduism)
with a view to fluency of speech and writing, and accurate
knowledge of the literature of the people.’” In all these
three items, he initiated a departure from old and accepted
methods of proselytism.

Soon after he began his work, he made some conversions
of high-placed people, and his fame spread throughout the
country, It is said that even the Nayak desired an inter-
view with him, which was, however, cleverly refused. This
initial success naturally created some flutterings in orthodox
circles, but the influence of ‘ Hermécatti’ (Erumaikatti),
a Polegar, prevented a crisis. On the 15th of January,
1609, de Nobili wrote: ‘ The tempest of the Brahmans has
passed.’ (Bertrand, ii, p. 26). Thus the reign of Muttu
Krishnappa saw the beginnings of Nobili’s endeavours in
the cause of Christianity.

Muttu Krishnappa's attitude towards the Vijayanagar
Emperor.—There are only a few inscriptions of Muttu
Krishnappa’s reign which indicate his attitude towards
Venkata 1, the Vijayanagar emperor. Two records of the
latter, dated 1602 and 1604, prove his authority in the
Nayak dominions.” There is only one inscription referring
to Muttu Krishnappa during his reign.” His copper coins
apparently prove his loyalty to the emperor; on the
obverse, there is the legend * Tiruvérhga(la)’ and on the
reverse *Mudu-Krishna’2' There are other coins of the

129,8, Chandler, The Jesuit Alission in Madura, p. 35.

'2 Appendix D, Nos. 99 and 101. 18 Thid., No. 104.

44 The obverse legend of this coin, Tiruvérhga(Ja), may have no connec-
tion with the name of the king Venkata. It may stand for the
patron god of the family of the Madura Nayaks, as the particular form
of Vishnu to which they were devoted. It will be remembered that
Erishnappa Nayaka installed this form of god Vishnu in the temple
he constructed in the new town Krishnipuram founded by him. If
that should turn out to beso, this would be something like an effort at
independence, but it is hardly a necessary inference in the face of the
statement of Cesar Frederick, who says that each provincial governor
issued copper coins of his own so that the traveller had to take fresh
change almost every day that he travelled. Zd,

Nayaks,"* according to Hultasch (Elliot Collection No, 177),
which mention ‘ Verhkatapa’ on the reverse, and contain
the fish-emblem, and are found in large numbers in the
bazaars of Madura, But there is no clear evidence that
they belong to Muttu Krishyappa. But Mr. Rangachari
thinks it is ‘ practically certain’ that they are his coins,
hecanse they are of the same typ as the former.’*

Throughout his reign Muttu Krishnappa was engaged
in the peaceful work of orderly administration. His
arrangements for the settlement of the Marava country
constituted a move in the right direction, though, in the long
run, the existence of a strong chicftaincy near Madura was
not an unmixed good. On occasions of vital emergency
and crisis, as we shall sce, it sometimes rallied to the cause
of the kingdom. Muttu Krishnappa’s dealings with the
missionaries reveal his broad-minded toleration and appre-
ciation of honest effort, provided it did not go against the
stability of the kingdom. A weak man, feeling the in-
security of his position, would not have given room for
such activities. His control over the coasts is clear from
Caldwell’s references,” and from the letter of Albert
Laerzio, dated November 20, 1609, where the Paravas are
described as the tributaries of the king of Madura and the
latter as the ally of the Portuguese.”  ITis gift of lands
to the Bhagavati temple at Cape Comorin and ‘ other
evidence’ clearly show that the Madura Nayak had com-
plete control over the Comorin Coast. Murther, Muttu
Krishnappa’s resources were devoted to ohjects of popular
approval, as the building of pagodas, grant of agrahdras,
and construction of tanks. He is also said to have built
a town called Krishndpuram between Madura and Skanda-
malai, and a Siva temple at Kayattitr.

His death.—The only real guide to the date of Muttu
Krishnappa’s death seems to be an inscription of his suc-
cessor, Muttu Virappa Nayaka, dated Kilaka,” which places
the latest limit of this event in April, 1609. Nelson and
Mr. Rangachari give the same year, though they fail to
mention on what authority their view is based. It is
worthy of note, however, that Laerzio’s letter of November
20, 1609, does not refer to the death of Muttu Krishnappa.

Muttu Krishnappa left three sons, Muttu Virappa,
Tirumala, and Kumara Muttu, according to the History of
the Carnataca Governors and some Mackenzie Manuscripts.
But the Mrtyunjaya Manuscripts and the Pédndyan
Chronicle do not mention Kumara Muttu. The Kiniyir
Plates of Venkata II say that Muttu Krishna had two sons,
Muitu Vira and Tirumala. There seems to be no reference
in any other inscriptions to a younger brother of Tirumala,
but they mention a Kumara Muttu Tirumala as the son of
Tirumala Nayaka. Therefore, that Muttu Krishnappa had
a third son cannot be accepted without further evidence.

MUTTU VIRAPPA NAYAKA I
(1609 ¢.1623)

MutTtTu ViraPpPa succeeded his father carly in 1609, The
most important question to examine in his rcign is his
attitude towards the Vijayanagar empire. Mr. Rangachari
takes it that his loyalty is beyond doubt. In support of
his opinion, he cites a copper-plate grant of 1609,' issued
by Venkata I at the request of Muttu Virappa Nayaka.
This proves nothing to the point, as il was at the very
commencement of his reign. Another inscription he refers
to is the damaged record of a Venkatadéva Maharaja,
making a gift for the merit of Virappa Nayaka in 1617?
But Venkata I died in 1014, Mr. Rangachari says that
‘even if he was a relation of the imperial family, the in-
scription is an evidence in favour of Virappa’s vassalage ’.*
This assumes the point to be proved, viz., the existence of
a Venkajadéva in the imperial royal family in 1617. A
third inscription, adduced by Mr. Rangachari to prove
his contention, is a copper-plate charter of 1620.4 This
record from the Coimbatore district is a grant by a
Raghunatha Mahiraja, the son of Sti Venkatndéva Maharaja
of Uraiydr, the agent of Visvanatha-Virappa Nayaka and
feudatory of Vira Ramadéva, then ruling at Penukonda.
As it refers to unknown maharajas of Uraiydr, it is a very

flimsy basis to support Muttu Virappa’s loyalty to the
empire.*

Other sources of information tend to show that Muttu
Virappa Nayaka, far from being loyal to his sovereign,
aimed at making himself independent of imperial control.
Vico, in his letter of the 30th of August, 1611, remarks that
he was irregular in the payment of tribute, and would never
pay it willingly.6 In the letter of Proenza, dated 1659, it is
said that Tirumala Nayaka only continued his predecessor's
policy of separation from the Vijayanagar empire.’
Barradas informs us that the Nayak of Madura joined
Jagga Raya, the unscrupulous traitor, in the imperial war
of succession that followed the death of Venkata I, and
that it was his help that prolonged that struggle. Mr.
Rangachari thinks that Muttu Virappa may have honestly
believed that the defeated party of Jagga Raya was in the
right ; but such a hypothesis, in the face of the plain facts,
must be proved before it can be accepted. Virappa’s
inscriptions from 1610 to 1623 give a strong negative proof
of his disregard of the imperial connection. They mention
only Muttu Virappa though some of them were issued by
him, and have nothing to say about the Vijayanagar
emperor. It is highly probable that the former took
advantage of the empire’s troublous days, consequent on
the death of Venkata I.°

8 The mahardjas of Uraiyir, mentioned in this record, may after all be
a family of petty chiefs or jeghirdars whose headquarters had been at
Uraiyar. The mention of Vira R@madéva as ruling at Penukonda is
evidence of the donor’s loyalty to the empire, as, at the date 1620, the
young prince Rama, who escaped massacre, was actually the ruler of
Vijayanagar. It will be remembered that it was in support of this
prince that Raghunatha Nayaka of Tanjore fought the battle of Toppii:
against a coalition of other governors under the leadership of the Nayak
of Madura.—£d.

A Jesuit letter of L2th June, 1610 says that ‘ Hermécatti
(Erumaikatti) Nayaka... distinguished himself by his
bravery, took some fortress by assault and returned victorious
from the war. The great Nayak Joaded him with honours
and new favours’. Another letter of 25th November, 1611,"
refers to a war between the Nayaks of Madura and Tanjore.
It is not known what caused it, and how it was brought to
aclose. This scems to be different from the war of 1616,

The death of the Vijayanagar emperor Venkata I in
1614 led to a tragic civil war between the loyal adherents
of the legal claimant to the throne, headed by Yachama
Nayaka, and the supporters of the putative son of Venkata
under the leadership of Jagga Raya. Voiled in the north

the province of Madura had showed a tendency to break off from the
imperial connection, at any rate, to disregard it, as the empire was
not conveniently placed to enlorce ils authority. Alter the first years
of reconstruction emperor ‘Tramaka was able to rehabilitate his position
toa great extent, and Krishnappa Niyakel, his canlemporary, seems to
have maintained the form, at any rate, of loyally. Itts this doubtiul
allegiance of the distant province of Madura, and possibly a similar
attitude on the part of the vieeroys of Srirangapathinam, that led to the
particular arrangement in regard lo the government of the empire on
the death of Tirmmala, Acgording to Wirumalit Aryangar, the minister
of Chikkadiva Riya of Mysore, the empire was put in commission, as it
were. The three sons of Tirumala suceeded to the government as a
whole } the eldest surviving one, Stiranga, had the general control over
the empire and ocenpied the throno, Tho next younger brother, Rima,
was given the viceroyally of Stirangapatjanam and made that his head«
guarters, Venkatapati, the last of the brothers, had his headquarters in
Chandragirt and was a sort of ovet-governor of the provinces af
what were the Tundira, Chola and Pandya kingdoms, that is, all the
Tamil country. Rather late in the reign of Virappa Niyaka an altempt
seems to have been made to overthrow the imperial authority, as this
game account says that when Sriranga died childless and probably
predeceased by Rima, Venkatapati snecoeded to the empire and almost
the first act of his reign was the suppression of a rebellion in Madura,
for which he deputed his first nephew, Tirtunala, the eldest son
of Réima, whose treason to the empire has already been referred to. It
was subsequently that Venkafapati led an invasion himself and brought
Virappa back to a sense of loyalty to ithe empire. In this campaign
Tanjore seems tu have stoud loyally by Venkatu, and the battle of
Vallamprakara, referred to in the Pudukottai Plates, has reference tu
this engagement. The Nayaks of Madura seem to have forgiven nelther
the emperor for this asserlion of authority nor the Niyaks ot Tanjore
for the loyal snpport that made this agsertion possible. ‘This general
hostility to the empire accounts for much that remains otherwise
inexplicable in the foreign polley of the Madura Nayaky,—d,

page 116: Muttu Virappa Nadyaka I 101

by the loyalist party, Jagga came to the south to join the
opposition of Madura and Gingi against loyalist Tanjore.
Muttu Virappa of Madura and the Nayak of Gingi had
already espoused his cause, and Raghunatha, the Nayak of
Tanjore, was the mainstay of the imperialist party of
Yachama Nayaka. The contest, which took place at
Trichinopoly, was not over in December, 1616, when
Barradas wrote his account. The Sdhityarainakaram and
the Raghundthabhyudayaum refer to this war, and claim the
victory for Tanjore; the latter speaks of the complete
defeat of Jagga Raya and the Madura Nayak, and the
former says that the Nayak of Madura destroyed the stone
dam across the Kaveri, and that the hostilities came to an
end by the marriage of his daughter with Raghunatha
Nayaka.§ Therefore the imperial cause seems to have
triumphed for the time.

The Pudukottai Plates of Sri Vallabha and Varatunga
Pandya, dated 1583,” describe a battle at Vallaprakara
(Vallam) between the armies of Venkata Raja (Venkata I)
and Vira Raja (Virappa Nayaka), in which the latter’s
forces were destroyed and those of Achyuta Raja (Achyu-
tappa Nayaka) fled away. If this is a reference to the
war of succession, fought in the south in 1616, the
date of the inscription will have to be revised. But there
was no Venkata at that time, and Achyutappa Nayaka had
already abdicated. Perhaps the expression ‘armies of
Venkata Raja and Achyuta Raja’ was loosely used for, the
forces of the loyalist party and of Raghunatha Nayaka.
If the date is correct, it is difficult to explain such a
combination of contending parties in 1583 or before. It is
said that this inscription was issued by Ativirarama’s
brother, presumably after his death. But Mr. Krishna
Sastri identifies Sri Vallabha with Ativirarama Pandya, and

Dr. Burnell refers to a copper-plate grant that puts the
latter’s death in 16010. Even then, it is hard to understand
how an inscription of Ativirarama could refer to the events
of 1016. Therefore nothing delinite can be said about the
value of this inscription in relation to the war of succes-
sion of 1616."

28°'The anvaston of Maduro, referred to in the previous note, by
Venkatapall Riya must have taken place soon after 1586.) Tho war
between Tanjore and Madura, referred to in the Jesult letters of
1610 and 1611, must be one in which the empire government had
taken no part, probably because it was involved in one of those
periodical struggles against the avgressions of the Muhammadans from
the north. It was in the you 1610 that RAja Udaiyiir was able to lay
siere to, and (ake possession of, Srirangapattanam from viceroy
Nrumala without imperial intervention, ‘This action on the part of
Raja Udnalyir received imperial confirmation in 1612, This ratification
of what might be construed as an acl of war against the empire was
probably owing to the diffictilties in whieh the empire was invelyed at
the time, and the same difficulties would explain any restivencss on
the pat of Madura about the same petiod. ‘The actual difficulties of
the empire are found clearly stated in the SaAffvaratnddaraue and
Raghundthibhyudayam, both of which relate to the history of the
Nayaks of ‘Tanjore, particularly Raghuniitha Nayaka. The emperor
Venkafapalt, who was not without a will to enforce his authority upon
the provinces of the empiie, was then invelved Ina war caused by the
Invasion of the imperial territories by the Muhanunadans of Gulkonda
and calminating ina sieve of Penukonda. At this (ime, the emperor
obtained the assistance of young Raphuniitha fromshis father, Achyu-
tappe Niyake of Tanjore, Raghunatha ts eredited with having beaten
back the Muhammadans from the siege of Penukonda and piven the
emperor niuch-needed relief. He is said to have then obtained as
a tavour from the emperor the release from prison of Krishnappa
Nayaka of Gingi, who had been thrown into it by Venkalapati os
punishment for an act of treason, The same situation probably consti-
tuted the influenciug motive tor Venkatapali Riiya, who not only looked
on with equanimity al the overthrow of his nephew in Srirangapattanam
by a feudatory of his, but actually accorded tmperial sanetion to the
transfer of the viceroyalty of Srirangapattanam from the recalcitrant
nephew to a possibly loyal feudatory, The slesze of Penukonda
therefore may have taken place in 1611 or 1612, and Rayhuniitha
must have returned to Tanjore in the same year or the year following.
Venkatapati died two years after, in 16]4, and was suceeeded by
Stiranga Chikkariiya, the nephew of Venkatapati and younger brother
of the late viceroy Tirnmala of Srirangapattanam, Tt was this nominu-
tion by Venkata of his nephew that brought about the war of succession,
Jagga Riya setting up 4 putative son of his sister, one of the queens of
Venkata. Failing in his efforts to prevont the accession of Srirang:
Chikkariya to the empire, Jagga Riya wreaked his vengeance by
massacring the whole of the royal family, But a loyal (chieftain,

Change of Capital.—The chronicles say nothing about
Muttu Virappa Nayaka’s transfer of capital from Madura to
Trichinopoly, though they speak of Tirumala Nayaka as
ruling from the latter place at the commencement of his
reign. In Guerreo’s Relation the Nayak is said to be holding
his court in Madura in 1604.4 Léon Besse,’ probably
basing himself on Jesuit records, says that ‘the Nayak of
Madura removed his court and army to Trichinopoly in
1616 with the object of making war with the king of
Tanjore’. This conclusion may be accepted."

escaped with the prince to the protection of the loyal vice1oy of Tanjore.
Jagga Riya also moved southward rapidly to prevent the fugitive
prince and general from successfully effecting their escape into
Tanjore, The prince and his protector were met at Kumbakonam by
Raghunftha and were taken in safety to Tanjore. Atthe time that
Jagga arrived near the island of Srirangam, the Nayak of Gingi, and
the Niiyak of Madura with his accessory Portuguese contingent
and even troops from Travancore, his feudatory Pfindyas, and, in
fact, all the feudatories of the empire were ready to join him as the
result of a previously organized effoit. Tanjore stood loyal: Mysore
does not appear to have interfered for the obvious reason that the
acquisition of Srirangapattanam was too recent, and Raja Udaiyar had
reason to be grateful to the late emperor for the conferment of the
viceroyalty upon him. In any case, there was no reason whatsoever for
Mysore to join in this combination, and theie was valid reason against
Raja Udaiyar’s doing so. All these transactions would have taken
time, and the battle at Toppiir, which was the result of the machina-
tlons of the feudatories, could not have taken place before 1616. A
detailed account of this battle 1s embodied in a report submitted by
one of the subordinates of Raghunadtha, and this report is dated the
month of Ashadha, in the cyclic year Nala: it would be some date in
Augtst-September of 1616-17. This 1eport is embodied in the Telugu
work Raghunathdbhyudayam by his son and successor, Vijayarighava
of Tanjore. It is clear from this that the battle of Vallampiakara,
referred to in the Pudukottai Plates (of date 1582-3), cannot be taken
to refer to the battle of Toppiir. In the battle of Toppir Venkata or
Virappa Niyaka of Madura or Achyuta of Tanjore, could none of them
have taken part. The only difficulty in regard to this date (1682-3)
is that, at that date or before it Venkata was not the emperor, but he
‘was as good as that, as the superior viceroy of the three governorships
in the Tundira, Chola, and Pandya countries. He may have
intervened in the war as regent of the emperor, Sriranga, and in his
own name as astperior viceroy, This is more than probable as his
elder brother Sriranga was a prisoner in the hands of the Golkonda
general in the year 1579-80.—Zd.

There are practically no reliable inscriptional records of

After the victory of Toppiir the hostility of Tanjore would have been

Portuguese from Negapatan, by destroying theden of the Sdlaga
chieftain at D&vikdtta at the mouth of the Coleroon, and by defeating
the disloyal combination against the empire, Tanjore must have gained
immensely in prestige and power. So far, there were no signs of

not clear whether there were any real Pandya rulers after
the reign of Muttu Virappa Nayaka.

On the whole, the Pandyas seem to have been loyal to
the Nayaks of Madura. The boast of Muttu Krishna and
Muttu Vira that they conquered the ‘ Vanchar’ (Pandyas)
was perhaps only a reflection of Visvanitha’s conqucst of
them.” The early Nayaks after Vigvanitha do not scem to
have undcriaken any military action against them. They
did not, probably, interfere much with thcir internal
administration, but they seem to have insisted only on
tribute, and military help when required. This quasi-
independent status was allowed them, perhaps to check
possible aggression from Travancore. There is ample
evidence to show that the Pandyas survived the establish-
ment of the Nayaks in Madura for nearly a century.

Mysore Aggression.—Mr. Rangachari is surprised that
Barradas does not mention Raja Udaiyar of Mysore in
connection with the imperial war of succession. He
argues, ‘from the condition of the times’, that he could
not but have taken part in it in the cause of the empire.
Lut his amplification of this statement only goes to prove
that the Raja of Mysore was a selfish and ageressive ruler.”
There seems to be no evidence to charge Barradas with
omission of facts in this instance. By regular conquests
and annexations during his long reign, Raja Udaiyar made
his territories conterminous with the dominions of Madura.
It appears probable that he took advantage of Muttu
Virappa’s engagement with Tanjore to send an army under
one, called ‘ Mukilan’ in the chronicles, to harry the
Dindigul province.” It is said that the Polegars of Viri-
pakshi and Kannivadi vigorously repulsed the invaders and
freed the country from danger. In return for this service,
the chronicles say, the former was honoured with the title

does not give any date for this invasion; Mr. Rangachari
says that it was about 1620, in which year, according to
him,” Raja Udaiyar diced.

Progress of Missionary Activitics.~—lEncouraged by the
first fruits of his labours, De Nobili built a new church in
1610, and secured some assistants, the chief of whom,
Antonio Vico, reached Madura on the L5th of September.
The latter’s letter of 22nd November, 1010,” says that ‘ the
court of the great Nayak began to take part in persecution
and menacing words came from the palace’. Laerzio’s Ietter
of 8th December, 1610, speaks of persecutions as rife in
that year.“ Another letter of 25th November, 1611, refers

almost at the end of his reign doves not appear to have comprised more
than the present-day district of Mysore with just the borderland beyond
the hills in Coimbatore and Salem. It seems clear that, while his terri-
tory may have been conterminous with (hat of the Nayaks of Madura,
he was in no such condition of security in his possession of the newly.
aequied viceroyalty, as to launch out into distant aggressions against
the torritory af the powerful Nayak of Madura. If he took any part in
the battle of Toppiir, it must have been on the side of the emperor, But
stich action ou tis part would have been an invitation for the aggressions
of the Nayak of Madura, who was by far the most powerful of the
Nayaks, with the exception perhaps of Tanjore. ‘This position of Rija
Udaiyar is confirmed by what we know of the operations that had to
be actually undeitaken against Samnalli and Bombajh in the reign of

aggressiveness in this connection, the Ndyak of Madura would have
thought twice before changing the capital to Trichinopoly. /a,
